expert and the determination of when to use any such expert opinion, shall be within our sole

Outpatient Hospital Observation
Observation services are hospital outpatient services given 
to determine if you need to be admitted as an inpatient or 
can be discharged. For outpatient hospital observation 
services to be covered, they must meet the Medicare criteria 
and be considered reasonable and necessary. Observation 
services are covered only when provided by the order of a 
physician or another individual authorized by state licensure 
law and hospital staff bylaws to admit patients to the hospital 
or order outpatient tests.
Note: Unless the provider has written an order to admit you 
as an inpatient to the hospital, you are an outpatient and pay 
the cost-sharing amounts for outpatient hospital services. 
Even if you stay in the hospital overnight, you might still be 
considered an “outpatient.” If you are not sure if you are an 
outpatient, you should ask the hospital staff. You can also 
find more information in a Medicare fact sheet called “Are 
You a Hospital Inpatient or Outpatient? If You Have 
Medicare – Ask!” This fact sheet is available on the Web at

Covered Routine Dental Benefits Included with Your Plan:     
Annual Maximum:  $3,000
· In general, preventive and routine dental services are not covered under Original Medicare.  
Your UnitedHealthcare Routine Dental Benefit provides coverage for preventive and other 
necessary dental services such as: 
o Exams
o Cleanings (Prophylaxis, Periodontal Maintenance, & Deep Cleanings)
o Fillings
o Crowns
o Bridges
o Root Canals
o Partial Dentures
o Complete Dentures
o Implants  
· Procedures used for cosmetic-only reasons (tooth bleaching/whitening, veneers, gingival 
recontouring), orthodontics, space maintenance, sales tax, charges for failure to keep 
appointments, dental case management, dental charges related to COVID screening, 
testing and vaccination, and unspecified procedures by report are not covered by the plan.  
After the annual maximum is exhausted, any remaining charges are your responsibility. 
Other limitations and exclusions are listed below.   
· This dental plan offers access to the robust UHC Dental National Medicare Advantage 
Network.  Network dentists have agreed to provide services at a negotiated rate.  If you see 
a network dentist, you cannot be billed more than that rate for covered services within the 
limitations of the plan.  Any fees associated with non-covered services are your 
responsibility.   
· For assistance finding a provider, please use the dental provider search tool at 
myUHCMedicare.com.  You may also call 1-866-480-1086 for help with finding a provider or 
scheduling a dental appointment
· This dental plan offers both in-network and out-of-network dental coverage, and all covered 
services have $0 copayment.  Out-of-network dentists are not contracted to accept plan 
payment as payment in full, so they might charge you for more than what the plan pays, 
even for services listed as $0 copayment.  Seeing a provider from the robust dental network 
can therefore result in substantial savings.  Benefits received out-of-network are subject to 
any in-network benefit maximums, limitations and/or exclusions. 
· Some covered services may consider prior tooth history and procedures in conjunction with 
frequency limitations. If you wish to discuss detailed information about your plan with your

dentist, you can find it in the UHC Dental Medicare quick reference guide at 
uhcmedicaredentalproviderqrg.com.  
· When you have covered dental services performed at a network dentist, the dentist will 
submit the claim on your behalf.  When you see an out-of-network dentist, often the dentist 
will submit a claim on your behalf. If they do not, then you can submit it directly using the 
following instructions:
o The claim submission must contain the following information:
§ Full member name and member ID number
§ Full provider name and address
§ List of dental services rendered with the corresponding ADA code(s)
§ Proof of payment in the form of a receipt, check copy, EOB, or a ledger 
statement from the provider showing a positive payment against the services 
rendered
o Mail all required claim information within 365 days from the date of service to: P.O. 
Box 644, Milwaukee, WI 53201
o Payment will be sent to the address listed on your account.  To update your address 
or for assistance with submitting claims, contact Customer Service at 1-866-480-1086 
TTY 711.
o Claims are paid within 30 days and an Explanation of Payment (EOP) will accompany 
check payment
· Dentists may ask you to sign an informed consent document detailing the risks, benefits, 
costs, and alternatives to all recommended treatments.  If you would like to learn more how 
your dental plan coverage relates to your proposed dental treatment and costs, you may ask 
your dentist to obtain a pre-treatment cost calculation from UHC Dental. If the provider has 
questions about how to obtain this information, they can contact UHC Dental using the 
number or website on the back of your Member ID card.
