      "make things easier, this chapter:\n",
      "· Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says \n",
      "“making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage decision” rather than \n",
      "“organization determination” or “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination” and \n",
      "“independent review organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.”\n",
      "· It also uses abbreviations as little as possible.\n",
