This program is available to \\nall Aetna Medicare Premier Plus (PPO) members who are temporarily in the visitor/traveler area and \\noutside our plan’s service area. Under our visitor/traveler program you may receive all plan covered \\nservices at in‑network cost sharing when you see a network provider. In most cases, when you receive \\nnon‑urgent/non‑emergency care from an out‑of‑network provider (a provider who is not an Aetna \\nMedicare provider), your share of the costs for your covered services may be higher (See Chapter 3, \\nSection 2.3 for more information.)
