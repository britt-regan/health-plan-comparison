Later in this chapter, \\nyou can find information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain \\nservices. \\n  \\n Section 1.1\\n Types of out‑of‑pocket costs you may pay for your covered services\\n  \\n To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of \\nout‑of‑pocket costs you may pay for your covered services.\\n •\\n A\\xa0“copayment”\\xa0is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You \\npay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 \\ntells you more about your copayments.)\\n“Coinsurance”\\xa0is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a \\ncoinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells \\nyou more about your coinsurance.)\\n •\\n  \\n Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should \\nnever pay deductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB \\neligibility to your provider, if applicable. \\n  \\n  \\n Section 1.2\\n What is the most you will pay for covered medical services?\\n  \\n Under our plan, there are two different limits on what you have to pay out‑of‑pocket for covered medical \\nservices: \\n •\\n Your in‑network maximum out‑of‑pocket amount (MOOP) is $5,500. This is the most you pay \\nduring the calendar year for covered plan services received from network providers. The amounts \\nyou pay for copayments and coinsurance for covered services from network providers count toward \\nthis in‑network maximum out‑of‑pocket amount. (The amounts you pay for services from \\nout‑of‑network providers do not count toward your in‑network maximum out‑of‑pocket amount. In \\naddition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your in‑network maximum \\nout‑of‑pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart.) If \\nyou have paid $5,500 for covered services from network providers, you will not have any \\nout‑of‑pocket costs for the rest of the year when you see our network providers. However, you must \\ncontinue to pay the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by \\nMedicaid or another third party).\\nYour combined maximum out‑of‑pocket amount is $8,950. This is the most you pay during the \\ncalendar year for covered plan services received from both in‑network and out‑of‑network \\nproviders. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for covered services count toward \\nthis combined maximum out‑of‑pocket amount. (In addition, amounts you pay for some services do \\nnot count toward your combined maximum out‑of‑pocket amount. These services are marked with \\nan asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart.) If you have paid $8,950 for covered services, you will have \\n100% coverage and will not have any out‑of‑pocket costs for the rest of the year for covered \\n •\\n 34\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for\\xa0Aetna Medicare Eagle Plan (PPO)\\n Chapter  4\\xa0 \\xa0Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n services. However, you must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B \\npremium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party).\\n  \\n Section 1.3\\n Our plan does not allow providers to “balance bill” you\\n  \\n As a member of Aetna Medicare Eagle Plan (PPO), an important protection for you is that you only have to \\npay your cost‑sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add \\nadditional separate charges, called “balance billing.” This protection applies even if we pay the provider \\nless than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don’t pay certain provider \\ncharges. \\n  \\n Here is how this protection works.\\xa0 \\n •\\n If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only \\nthat amount for any covered services from a network provider. You will generally have higher \\ncopays when you obtain care from out‑of‑network providers.\\nIf your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more \\nthan that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see:\\n •\\n If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance \\npercentage multiplied by the plan’s reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract \\nbetween the provider and the plan).\\xa0\\nIf you receive the covered services from an out‑of‑network provider who participates with \\nMedicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for \\nparticipating providers.\\xa0\\nIf you receive the covered services from an out‑of‑network provider who does not participate \\nwith Medicare, then you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment \\nrate for non‑participating providers. \\xa0\\n ○\\n ○\\n ○\\n •\\n If you believe a provider has “balance billed” you, call Member Services.\\n  \\n Use the\\xa0Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered and how much \\nyou will pay\\n SECTION 2\\n  \\n Section 2.1\\n Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan\\n  \\n The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Aetna Medicare Eagle Plan (PPO) \\ncovers and what you pay out‑of‑pocket for each service.

A medical emergency is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse.
