Your covered services for prescription drugs are discussed in Chapter 5.\\n Section 1.2\\n Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan\\n As a Medicare health plan, Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO) must cover all services covered by Original \\nMedicare and must follow Original Medicare\\'s coverage rules.\\n Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO) will generally cover your medical care as long as:\\n • The care you receive is included in the plan\\'s Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this \\n document).\\n • The care you receive is considered medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, \\n supplies, equipment, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical \\ncondition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.\\n • You have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a \\n member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this \\nchapter).\\n – In most situations, your network PCP may give you approval in advance before you can use other providers \\nin the plan\\'s network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, or home health care agencies. \\nThis is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more information about this, see Section 2.3 of this chapter.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services\\n 36\\n • Flu shots, COVID-19 vaccinations, Hepatitis B vaccinations, and pneumonia vaccinations as long as you get \\n them from a network provider.\\n • Emergency services from network providers or from out-of-network providers\\n • Urgently needed services are covered services that are not emergency services, provided when the network \\nproviders are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible or when the enrollee is out of the service area. For \\nexample, you need immediate care during the weekend. Services must be immediately needed and \\nmedically necessary.\\n • Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare-certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside \\nthe plan\\'s service area. (If possible, please call Customer Care before you leave the service area so we can \\nhelp arrange for you to have maintenance dialysis while you are away.)\\n • All covered preventive services from network providers. These services are indicated in the Chapter 4 Medical \\n Benefits Chart with an \\n .  \\n • Partial hospitalization services from a network provider\\n • Dermatology services from a network provider.

These services are indicated in the Chapter 4 Medical Benefits \\n Chart with an asterisk (*)\\n Section 2.3\\n How to get care from specialists and other network providers\\n A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many \\nkinds of specialists. Here are a few examples:\\n • Oncologists care for patients with cancer.\\n • Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions.\\n • Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions.\\n Referrals\\n Remember, you may need a referral from your PCP to see a specialist. Even if you have a referral for one type of \\ncare from a specialist, you may need another referral from your PCP if a new service or treatment is added. \\n All in-network specialists are listed in the Provider Directory, which you can find at Humana.com/findadoctor. Keep \\nin mind, just because providers are in network doesn\\'t mean that your PCP will provide referrals to all of them. \\nYou\\'ll need to ask which hospitals and specialists your PCP uses for referrals. \\n For some types of services, your PCP may need to get approval in advance from our plan (this is called getting \"prior \\nauthorization\"). See Chapter 4, Section 2.1 for information about which services require prior authorization.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services\\n 37\\n What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan?\\n We may make changes to the hospitals, doctors, and specialists (providers) that are part of your plan during the \\nyear. If your doctor or specialist leaves your plan you have certain rights and protections that are summarized \\nbelow:\\n • Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we furnish you \\n with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists.\\n • We will make a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days\\' notice that your provider is leaving our \\n plan so that you have time to select a new provider.\\n • We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs.\\n •\\n If you are undergoing medical treatment, you have the right to request, and we will work with you to ensure \\nthat the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted.\\n •\\n If our network does not have a qualified specialist for a plan-covered service, we must cover that service at \\nin-network cost sharing when the service is received from an out-of-network specialist. Prior authorization is \\nrequired for service to be covered.\\n •\\n If you find out your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a \\nnew provider to manage your care.\\n •\\n If you believe we have not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous provider or that \\nyour care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file a quality of care complaint to the \\nQIO, a quality of care grievance to the plan, or both. Please see Chapter 9.\\n Contact Customer Care at 1-800-457-4708, TTY 711 for assistance with selecting a new qualified provider to \\ncontinue managing your health care needs.\\n Section 2.4\\n How to get care from out-of-network providers\\n Your network PCP or plan must give you approval in advance before you can use providers not in the plan\\'s \\nnetwork. This is called giving you a \"referral.\" For more information about this and situations when you can see an \\nout-of-network provider without a referral (such as an emergency), see Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of this chapter. If you \\ndon\\'t have a referral (approval in advance) before you get services from an out-of-network provider, you may have \\nto pay for these services yourself.\\n For some types of services, your doctor may need to get approval in advance from our plan (this is called getting \\n\"prior authorization\"). See Chapter 4, Section 2.1 for more information about which services require prior \\nauthorization.\\n It is best to ask an out-of-network provider to bill the plan first. But, if you have already paid for the covered \\nservices, we will reimburse you for our share of the cost for covered services. Or if an out-of-network provider sends \\nyou a bill that you think we should pay, you can send it to us for payment. See Chapter 7 (Asking us to pay our share \\nof a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs) for information about what to do if you receive a bill \\nor if you need to ask for reimbursement.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services\\n 39\\n after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious \\ndanger, we will cover your care.\\n However, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only if you get the \\nadditional care in one of these two ways:\\n • You go to a network provider to get the additional care.\\n • – or – The additional care you get is considered \"urgently needed services\" and you follow the rules for \\n getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below).\\n Section 3.2\\n Getting care when you have an urgent need for services\\n What are \"urgently needed services\"?\\n An urgently needed service is a non-emergency situation requiring immediate medical care but given your \\ncircumstances, it is not possible or not reasonable to obtain these services from a network provider. The plan must \\ncover urgently needed services provided out of network. Some examples of urgently needed services are i) a severe \\nsore throat that occurs over the weekend or ii) an unforeseen flare-up of a known condition when you are \\ntemporarily outside the service area.\\n The plan\\'s Provider Directory will tell you which facilities in your area are in-network. This information can also be \\nfound online at Humana.com/findadoctor. For any other questions regarding urgently needed services, please \\ncontact Customer Care.\\n Our plan covers worldwide emergency and urgent care services outside of the United States under the following \\ncircumstances. If you have an emergency or an urgent need for care outside of the U.S. and its territories, you will \\nbe responsible to pay for those services upfront and request appropriate reimbursement from us. We will \\nreimburse you, for covered out-of-network emergency and urgent care services outside of the U.S. and its \\nterritories, at rates no greater than the rates at which Original Medicare would pay for such services had the \\nservices been performed in the United States in the locality where you reside. The amount we pay you, if any, will \\nbe reduced by any applicable cost-sharing. Because we will reimburse at rates no greater than the rates at which \\nOriginal Medicare would reimburse, and because foreign providers might charge more for services than the rates at \\nwhich Original Medicare would pay, the total of our reimbursement plus the applicable cost-sharing may be less \\nthan the amounts you pay the foreign provider. This is a supplemental benefit not generally covered by Medicare. \\nYou must submit proof of payment to Humana for reimbursement. See Chapter 4 (Medical Benefits Chart, what is \\ncovered and what you pay) for more information. If you have already paid for the covered services, we will \\nreimburse you for our share of the cost for covered services. You can send the bill with medical records to us for \\npayment consideration. See Chapter 7 (Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical \\nservices or drugs) for information about what to do if you receive a bill or if you need to ask for reimbursement.\\n Section 3.3\\n Getting care during a disaster\\n If the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States \\ndeclares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still entitled to care from your plan.\\n Please visit the following website: Humana.com/alert for information on how to obtain needed care during a \\ndisaster.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services\\n 40\\n If you cannot use a network provider during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care from out-of-network \\nproviders at in-network cost-sharing. If you cannot use a network pharmacy during a disaster, you may be able to \\nfill your prescription drugs at an out-of-network pharmacy. Please see Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for more information.\\n SECTION 4\\n What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your services?\\n Section 4.1\\n You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services\\n If you have paid more than your plan cost-sharing for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost \\nof covered medical services, go to Chapter 7 (Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical \\nservices or drugs) for information about what to do.\\n Section 4.2\\n If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost\\n Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO) covers all medically necessary services as listed in the Medical Benefits Chart \\nin Chapter 4 of this document. If you receive services not covered by our plan or services obtained out-of-network \\nand were not authorized, you are responsible for paying the full cost of services.\\n For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you get after you have \\nused up your benefit for that type of covered service. Paying for costs once a benefit limit has been reached will not \\ncount toward your out-of-pocket maximum. You can call Customer Care when you want to know how much of \\nyour benefit limit you have already used.\\n SECTION 5\\n How are your medical services covered when you are in a  \\n\"clinical research study\"?\\n Section 5.1\\n What is a \"clinical research study\"?\\n A clinical research study (also called a \"clinical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical \\ncare, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research studies are approved by Medicare. Clinical \\nresearch studies approved by Medicare typically request volunteers to participate in the study.\\n Once Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study will contact you to \\nexplain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the \\nstudy. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study, and you have a full \\nunderstanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study.\\n If you participate in a Medicare-approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the covered services \\nyou receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical trial, then you are only responsible \\nfor the in-network cost sharing for the services in that trial. If you paid more, for example, if you already paid the \\nOriginal Medicare cost-sharing amount, we will reimburse the difference between what you paid and the \\nin-network cost sharing. However, you will need to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When \\nyou are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the \\ncare that is not related to the study) through our plan.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services\\n 42\\n SECTION 6\\n Rules for getting care covered in a \"religious non-medical  \\nhealth care institution\"\\n Section 6.1\\n What is a religious non-medical health care institution?\\n A religious non-medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily \\nbe treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a \\nmember\\'s religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non-medical health care \\ninstitution. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non-medical health care services).\\n Section 6.2\\n Receiving Care from a Religious Non-Medical Health Care Institution\\n To get care from a religious non-medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are \\nconscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is \"non-excepted.\"\\n •\\n \"Non-excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required \\nby any federal, state, or local law.\\n •\\n \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required \\nunder federal, state, or local law.\\n To be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non-medical health care institution must meet the \\nfollowing conditions:\\n • The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare.\\n • Our plan\\'s coverage of services you receive is limited to non-religious aspects of care.\\n •\\n If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions apply:\\n – You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for inpatient hospital \\n care or skilled nursing facility care.\\n – – and – you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility, or your \\n stay will not be covered.\\n Medicare Inpatient Hospital coverage limits apply (please refer to the Medicare Benefits Chart in Chapter 4).\\n SECTION 7\\n Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment\\n Section 7.1\\n Will you own the durable medical equipment after making a certain  \\nnumber of payments under our plan?\\n Durable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, \\npowered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating devices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, \\nand hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. The member always owns certain items, such as \\nprosthetics. In this section, we discuss other types of DME that you must rent.\\n EOC076\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 4.

Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n 45\\n SECTION 1\\n Understanding your out-of-pocket costs for covered services\\n This chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart that lists your covered services and shows how much you will pay \\nfor each covered service as a member of Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO). Later in this chapter, you can find \\ninformation about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Also, see \\nexclusions and limitations pertaining to certain supplemental benefits in the chart in this chapter.\\n Section 1.1\\n Types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services\\n To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of \\nout-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services.\\n • A \"copayment\" is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a \\n copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more \\nabout your copayments.)\\n •\\n \"Coinsurance\" is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at \\nthe time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your \\ncoinsurance.)\\n Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should never pay \\ndeductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider, \\nif applicable.\\n Section 1.2\\n What is the most you will pay for Medicare Part A and Part B covered  \\nmedical services?\\n Because you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit on the total amount you have to pay \\nout-of-pocket each year for in-network medical services that are covered under Medicare Part A and Part B. This \\nlimit is called the maximum out-of-pocket amount (MOOP) for medical services. For calendar year 2023 this \\namount is $3,000.\\n The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for in-network covered services count toward this \\nmaximum out-of-pocket amount. The amount you pay for your Part D prescription drugs does not count toward \\nyour out-of-pocket maximum. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your \\nmaximum out-of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart. The \\namounts you pay for any late enrollment penalty and your Part D prescription drugs do not count toward your \\nmaximum out-of-pocket amount. If you reach the maximum out-of-pocket amount of $3,000, you will not have \\nto pay any out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for in-network covered Part A and Part B services. However, \\nyou must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or \\nanother third party).\\n Section 1.3\\n Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you\\n As a member of Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO), an important protection for you is that you only have to pay \\nyour cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add additional, separate \\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 4. Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n 46\\n charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges \\nfor a service and even if there is a dispute and we don\\'t pay certain provider charges.\\n Here is how this protection works.\\n •\\n If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that \\namount for any covered services from a network provider.\\n •\\n If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that \\npercentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see:\\n – If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied \\n by the plan\\'s reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan).\\n – If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay \\n the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers. \\n(Remember, the plan covers services from out-of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when \\nyou get a referral or for emergencies or urgently needed services.)\\n – If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare, \\n you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non-participating \\nproviders. (Remember, the plan covers services from out-of-network providers only in certain situations, such \\nas when you get a referral or for emergencies or urgently needed services.)\\n •\\n If you believe a provider has \"balance billed\" you, call Customer Care.\\n SECTION 2\\n Use the Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered and  \\nhow much you will pay\\n Section 2.1\\n Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan\\n The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO) covers \\nand what you pay out-of-pocket for each service. Part D prescription drug coverage is in Chapter 5. The services \\nlisted in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met:\\n • Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines established by Medicare.\\n • Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment, and Part B prescription drugs) must be \\nmedically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the \\nprevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical \\npractice.\\n • You receive your care from a network provider. In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-network provider \\nwill not be covered, unless it is emergent or urgent care or unless your plan or a network provider has given you \\na referral. This means that you will have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished.\\n • You have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. In most situations, your PCP \\nmust give you approval in advance before you can see other providers in the plan\\'s network.

Using the plan\\'s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n 86\\n SECTION 1\\n Introduction\\n This chapter explains rules for using your coverage for Part D drugs. Please see Chapter 4 for Medicare Part B \\ndrug benefits and hospice drug benefits.\\n Section 1.1\\n Basic rules for the plan\\'s Part D drug coverage\\n The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:\\n • You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist or other prescriber) write you a prescription which must be valid \\n under applicable state law.\\n • Your prescriber must not be on Medicare’s Exclusion or Preclusion Lists.\\n • You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 2, Fill your prescriptions at a \\n network pharmacy or through the plan\\'s mail-order service.)\\n • Your drug must be in the plan\\'s Prescription Drug Guide (Formulary) (we call it the \"Drug Guide\" for short). (See \\n Section 3, Your drugs need to be in the plan\\'s \"Drug Guide.\")\\n • Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A \"medically accepted indication\" is a use of the \\ndrug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. \\n(See Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.)\\n SECTION 2\\n Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through the  \\nplan\\'s mail-order service\\n Section 2.1\\n Use a network pharmacy\\n In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan\\'s network pharmacies. (See Section \\n2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies.)\\n A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered prescription drugs. \\nThe term \"covered drugs\" means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are in the plan\\'s Drug Guide.\\n Section 2.2\\n Network pharmacies\\n How do you find a network pharmacy in your area?\\n To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Provider Directory, visit our website \\n(Humana.com/PlanDocuments), and/or call Customer Care.\\n You may go to any of our network pharmacies. Contact us to find out more about how your out-of-pocket costs \\ncould vary for different drugs.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 6. What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n 117\\n SECTION 9\\n Part D Vaccines. What you pay for depends on how and where  \\nyou get them\\n Important Message About What You Pay for Vaccines - Our plan covers most Part D vaccines at no cost to you. \\nCall Customer Care for more information. \\n There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations:\\n • The first part of coverage is the cost of the vaccine itself. \\n • The second part of coverage is for the cost of giving you the vaccine. (This is sometimes called the \\n \"administration\" of the vaccine.)\\n Your costs for a Part D vaccination depend on three things:\\n 1.  The type of vaccine (what you are being vaccinated for).\\n • Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. (See the Medical Benefits Chart, (what is covered and what \\n you pay) in Chapter 4.)\\n • Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan\\'s Drug Guide \\n (Formulary).\\n 2.  Where you get the vaccine.\\n • The vaccine itself may be dispensed by a pharmacy or provided by the doctor’s office.\\n 3.  Who gives you the vaccine.\\n • A pharmacist may give you the vaccine in the pharmacy, or another provider may give it in the doctor’s \\n office.\\n What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the circumstances and what Drug \\nStage you are in.\\n • Sometimes when you get a vaccination, you have to pay for the entire cost for both the vaccine itself and the \\ncost for the provider to give you the vaccine. You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost.\\n • Other times, when you get the vaccination, you will pay only your share of the cost under your Part D benefit.\\n Below are three examples of ways you might get a Part D vaccine.\\n Situation 1:\\n You get your vaccination at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have this choice depends on \\nwhere you live. Some states do not allow pharmacies to give vaccines.)\\n • You will pay the pharmacy your coinsurance or copayment for the vaccine itself which \\n includes the cost of giving you the vaccine.\\n • Our plan will pay the remainder of the costs.\\n Situation 2:\\n You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor\\'s office.\\n 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 9. What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)\\n 140\\n This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in Chapter 4 of this \\ndocument: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay). To keep things simple, we generally refer to \\n\"medical care coverage\" or \"medical care\" which includes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B \\nprescription drugs. In some cases, different rules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, \\nwe will explain how the rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and \\nservices.\\n This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations:\\n 1.  You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan. Ask \\n for a coverage decision. Section 5.2.\\n 2.  Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you \\n believe that this care is covered by the plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2.\\n 3.  You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not \\n pay for this care. Make an appeal. Section 5.3. \\n 4.  You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to \\n ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section 5.5.\\n 5.  You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved \\nwill be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. Make \\nan appeal. Section 5.3.\\n NOTE: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility \\ncare, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services, you need to read sections 7 and 8 \\nof this Chapter. Special rules apply to these types of care.\\n |Legal Terms|\\n|When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination.\" A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\"| 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Humana Gold Plus H1036-074 (HMO)\\nChapter 12.
