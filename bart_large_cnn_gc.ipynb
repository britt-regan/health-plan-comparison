Medicaid coverage varies depending on \\nthe state and the type of Medicaid you have. Some people with Medicaid get help paying for \\ntheir Medicare premiums and other costs. Other people also get coverage for additional \\nservices and drugs that are not covered by Medicare.\\nYou have chosen to get your Medicare health care and your prescription drug coverage through \\nour plan, UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP). We are required to cover all Part A \\nand Part B services. However, cost sharing and provider access in this plan differ from Original \\nMedicare.\\nUnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) is a specialized Medicare Advantage Plan (a \\nMedicare “Special Needs Plan”), which means its benefits are designed for people with special \\nhealth care needs. UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) is designed for people \\nwho have Medicare and who are also entitled to assistance from Medicaid. \\nBecause you get assistance from Medicaid, you will pay less or nothing for some of your Medicare \\nhealth care services. Medicaid may also provide other benefits to you by covering health care \\nservices and prescription drugs that are not usually covered under Medicare. You will also receive \\n“Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for the costs of your Medicare prescription drugs. \\nUnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) will help manage all of these benefits for \\nyou, so that you get the health care services and payment assistance that you are entitled to.\\nOur plan is a Medicare Advantage HMO Plan (HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization) \\nwith a Point-of-Service (POS) option approved by Medicare and run by a private company. “Point-\\nof-Service” means you can use providers outside the plan’s network for an additional cost. (See \\nChapter 3, Section 2.3 for information about using the Point-of-Service option.) Like all Medicare \\nAdvantage plans, this Medicare Special Needs Plan is approved by Medicare. The plan also has a \\ncontract with the Alabama Medicaid program to coordinate your Medicaid benefits. We are \\npleased to be providing your Medicare health care coverage, including your prescription drug \\ncoverage.\\nCoverage under this Plan qualifies as Qualifying Health Coverage (QHC) and satisfies the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) individual shared responsibility requirement. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n3\\nPlease visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website at: www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/\\nindividuals-and-families for more information.\\nSection 1.2 \\nWhat is the Evidence of Coverage document about?\\nThis Evidence of Coverage document tells you how to get your Medicare and Medicaid medical \\ncare and prescription drugs. It explains your rights and responsibilities, what is covered, what you \\npay as a member of the plan, and how to file a complaint if you are not satisfied with a decision or \\ntreatment.\\nThe words “coverage” and “covered services” refer to the medical care, services and prescription \\ndrugs available to you as a member of the plan.\\nIt’s important for you to learn what the plan’s rules are and what services are available to you. We \\nencourage you to set aside some time to look through this Evidence of Coverage document. \\nIf you are confused, concerned or just have a question, please contact Customer Service.\\nSection 1.3 \\nLegal information about the Evidence of Coverage \\nThis Evidence of Coverage is part of our contract with you about how the plan covers your care. \\nOther parts of this contract include your enrollment form, the List of Covered Drugs (Formulary), \\nand any notices you receive from us about changes to your coverage or conditions that affect your \\ncoverage. These notices are sometimes called “riders” or “amendments.”\\nThe contract is in effect for months in which you are enrolled in the plan between January 1, 2023 \\nand December 31, 2023.\\nEach calendar year, Medicare allows us to make changes to the plans that we offer. This means we \\ncan change the costs and benefits of the plan after December 31, 2023. We can also choose to \\nstop offering the plan, or to offer it in a different service area, after December 31, 2023.\\nMedicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) must approve our plan each year. You \\ncan continue each year to get Medicare coverage as a member of our plan as long as we choose to \\ncontinue to offer the plan and Medicare renews its approval of the plan.\\nSection 2 \\nWhat makes you eligible to be a plan member?\\nSection 2.1 \\nYour eligibility requirements \\nYou are eligible for membership in our plan as long as:\\n· You have both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B\\n· -- and -- you live in our geographic service area (Section 2.4 below describes our service area). \\nIncarcerated individuals are not considered living in the geographic service area even if they \\nare physically located in it.\\n· -- and -- you are a United States citizen or are lawfully present in the United States\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n4\\n· -- and -- you meet the special eligibility requirements described below.\\nSpecial eligibility requirements for our plan\\nOur plan is designed to meet the needs of people who receive certain Medicaid benefits. (Medicaid \\nis a joint Federal and state government program that helps with medical costs for certain people \\nwith limited incomes and resources.) To be eligible for our plan you must be eligible for both \\nMedicare and Medicaid.\\nPlease note: If you lose your Medicaid eligibility but can reasonably be expected to regain eligibility \\nwithin 6 month(s), then you are still eligible for membership in our plan (Chapter 4, Section 2.1 tells \\nyou about coverage during a period of deemed continued eligibility).\\nSection 2.2 \\nWhat is Medicaid?\\nMedicaid is a joint Federal and state government program that helps with medical costs for certain \\npeople who have limited incomes and resources. Each state decides what counts as income and \\nresources, who is eligible, what services are covered, and the cost for services. States also can \\ndecide how to run their program as long as they follow the Federal guidelines. \\nIn addition, there are programs offered through Medicaid that help people with Medicare pay their \\nMedicare costs, such as their Medicare premiums. These “Medicare Savings Programs” help \\npeople with limited income and resources save money each year.\\nYou can enroll in this plan if you are in one of these Medicaid categories:\\n· Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Plus (QMB+): You get Medicaid coverage of Medicare \\ncost-share and are also eligible for full Medicaid benefits. Medicaid pays your Medicare Part \\nA premium (under limited circumstances) and Part B premium, deductibles, coinsurance \\nand copayment amounts for Medicare covered services. You pay nothing, except for Part D \\nprescription drug copays (if applicable).\\n· Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB): You get Medicaid coverage of Medicare cost-share \\nbut are not eligible for full Medicaid benefits. Medicaid pays your Medicare Part A premium \\n(under limited circumstances) and Part B premium, deductibles, coinsurance and \\ncopayment amounts only for Medicare covered services.

You are eligible for full Medicaid benefits. At \\ntimes you may also be eligible for limited assistance from your state Medicaid agency in \\npaying your Medicare cost share amounts. Generally your cost share is 0% when the service \\nis covered by both Medicare and Medicaid. There may be cases where you have to pay cost \\nsharing when a service or benefit is not covered by Medicaid.\\n· Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB): Medicaid pays your Part B premium \\nonly. The State Medicaid Office does not pay your cost-share. You do not have full Medicaid \\nbenefits.

IMPORTANT – If you have Medicare and  Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid), make sure to \\nshow your UnitedHealthcare member ID card whenever you access services. This will help your \\nprovider bill correctly. Here’s a sample UnitedHealthcare member ID card to show you what yours \\nwill look like:\\nSAMPLE\\nYour UnitedHealthcare Plan Name (XXX)\\nGroup Number: 99999                H9999-999-999\\nCopay: PCP $XX      \\n           Specialist: $XX\\nRxBIN\\n999999\\nRxPCN\\n9999\\nRxGRP\\nXXX\\nSample A. Sample\\nMember Number\\n999999999-00\\nDo NOT use your red, white, and blue Medicare card for covered medical services while you are a \\nmember of this plan. If you use your Medicare card instead of your UnitedHealthcare member ID \\ncard, you may have to pay the full cost of medical services yourself. Keep your Medicare card in a \\nsafe place. You may be asked to show it if you need hospital services, hospice services, or \\nparticipate in Medicare approved clinical research studies also called clinical trials.\\nIf your UnitedHealthcare member ID card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call Customer Service right \\naway and we will send you a new card.\\nSection 3.2 \\nProvider Directory\\nThe Provider Directory lists our network providers and durable medical equipment suppliers. \\nNetwork providers are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, durable \\nmedical equipment suppliers, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement \\nwith us to accept our payment and any plan cost-sharing as payment in full.\\nYou must use network providers to get your medical care and services, except for routine dental \\nservices. If you go elsewhere without proper authorization you will have to pay in full. The only \\nexceptions are emergencies, urgently needed services when the network is not available (that is, in \\nsituations when it is unreasonable or not possible to obtain services in-network), out-of-area dialysis \\nservices, and cases in which our plan authorizes use of out-of-network providers.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n7\\nMembers of this plan may use their Point of Service (POS) benefits to see non-network providers \\nfor routine dental services only. Please refer to Chapter 3 (Using the plan’s coverage for your \\nmedical services) for more specific information about POS.\\nThe most recent list of providers and suppliers is available on our website at myUHCMedicare.com.\\nIf you don’t have your copy of the Provider Directory, you can request a copy from Customer \\nService.\\nSection 3.3 \\nPharmacy Directory\\nThe pharmacy directory lists our network pharmacies. Network pharmacies are all of the \\npharmacies that have agreed to fill covered prescriptions for our plan members. You can use the \\nPharmacy Directory to find the network pharmacy you want to use. See Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for \\ninformation on when you can use pharmacies that are not in the plan’s network.\\nIf you don’t have the Pharmacy Directory, you can get a copy from Customer Service. You can \\nalso find this information on our website at myUHCMedicare.com.\\nSection 3.4 \\nThe plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)\\nThe plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary). We call it the “Drug List” for short. It tells which \\nPart D prescription drugs are covered under the Part D benefit included in our plan. The drugs on \\nthis list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must \\nmeet requirements set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the plan’s Drug List.\\nIn addition to the drugs covered by Part D, some prescription drugs are covered for you under your \\nMedicaid benefits. You can learn more about prescription drug coverage under your Medicaid \\nbenefits by contacting your Medicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) listed in Chapter \\n2 of this booklet. Your Medicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) may also be able to \\nprovide a Medicaid Drug List that tells you how to find out which drugs are covered under \\nMedicaid. \\nThe Drug List also tells you if there are any rules that restrict coverage for your drugs.\\nWe will provide you a copy of the Drug List. To get the most complete and current information \\nabout which drugs are covered, you can visit the plan’s website (myUHCMedicare.com) or call \\nCustomer Service.\\nSection 4 \\nYour monthly costs for the plan\\nYour costs may include the following:\\n· Plan Premium (Section 4.1)\\n· Medicare Part B Premium (Section 4.2)\\n· Part D Late Enrollment Penalty (Section 4.3)\\n· Income Related Monthly Adjusted Amount (Section 4.4)\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n8\\nIn some situations, your plan premium could be less\\nThe “Extra Help” program helps people with limited resources pay for their drugs. Chapter 2, \\nSection 7 tells more about this program. If you qualify, enrolling in the program might lower your \\nmonthly plan premium.\\nIf you are already enrolled and getting help from this program, the information about premiums \\nin this Evidence of Coverage may not apply to you.\\nMedicare Part B and Part D premiums differ for people with different incomes. If you have \\nquestions about these premiums review your copy of Medicare & You 2023 handbook, the section \\ncalled “2023 Medicare Costs.” If you need a copy you can download it from the Medicare website \\n(www.medicare.gov). Or, you can order a printed copy by phone at 1-800-MEDICARE \\n(1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048.\\nSection 4.1 \\nPlan premium\\nAs a member of our plan, you pay a monthly plan premium unless you qualify for “Extra Help” with \\nyour prescription drug costs. You may not pay a monthly Plan premium (prescription drug plan \\npremium) if you qualify for “Extra Help”. People with Medicare and Medicaid automatically qualify \\nfor “Extra Help”. For 2023, the monthly premium for our plan is $32.10.\\nSection 4.2 \\nMedicare Part B Premium\\nMany members are required to pay other Medicare premiums\\nIn addition to paying the monthly plan premium, some members are required to pay other \\nMedicare premiums. As explained in Section 2 above, in order to be eligible for our plan, you must \\nmaintain your eligibility for Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) as well as have both Medicare Part A and \\nMedicare Part B. For most UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) members, \\nAlabama Medicaid (Medicaid) pays for your Part A premium (if you don’t qualify for it automatically) \\nand for your Part B premium.\\nIf Medicaid is not paying your Medicare premiums for you, you must continue to pay your \\nMedicare premiums to remain a member of the plan. This includes your premium for Part B. It \\nmay also include a premium for Part A which affects members who aren’t eligible for premium free \\nPart A.\\nSection 4.3 \\nPart D Late Enrollment Penalty\\nBecause you are dual-eligible, the LEP doesn’t apply as long as you maintain your dual-eligible \\nstatus, but if you lose status you may incur LEP. Some members are required to pay a Part D late \\nenrollment penalty. The Part D late enrollment penalty is an additional premium that must be paid \\nfor Part D coverage if at any time after your initial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 \\ndays or more in a row when you did not have Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. \\n“Creditable prescription drug coverage” is coverage that meets Medicare’s minimum standards \\nsince it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n9\\ncoverage. The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you went without Part D or \\nother creditable prescription drug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you \\nhave Part D coverage.\\nThe Part D late enrollment penalty is added to your monthly premium. When you first enroll in our \\nplan, we let you know the amount of the penalty. \\nYou will not have to pay it if:\\n· You receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs.\\n· You have gone less than 63 days in a row without creditable coverage.\\n· You have had creditable drug coverage through another source such as a former employer, \\nunion, TRICARE, or Department of Veterans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources \\ndepartment will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This \\ninformation may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this \\ninformation, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later.\\n° Note: Any notice must state that you had “creditable” prescription drug coverage that is \\nexpected to pay as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug plan pays.\\n° Note: The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage: prescription drug \\ndiscount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites.\\nMedicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works:\\n· If you went 63 days or more without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage after \\nyou were first eligible to enroll in Part D, the plan will count the number of full months that you \\ndid not have coverage. The penalty is 1% for every month that you did not have creditable \\ncoverage. For example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%.\\n· Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug \\nplans in the nation from the previous year. For 2023, this average premium amount is $32.74.\\n· To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average \\nmonthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In the example here it would be \\n14% times $32.74, which equals $4.58. This rounds to $4.60. This amount would be added to \\nthe monthly premium for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty.\\nThere are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment penalty:\\n· First, the penalty may change each year, because the average monthly premium can change \\neach year. \\n· Second, you will continue to pay a penalty every month for as long as you are enrolled in a \\nplan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you change plans. \\n· Third, if you are under 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the Part D late enrollment \\npenalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your Part D late enrollment penalty will be \\nbased only on the months that you don’t have coverage after your initial enrollment period for \\naging into Medicare. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n10\\nIf you disagree about your Part D late enrollment penalty, you or your representative can ask for a \\nreview. Generally, you must request this review within 60 days from the date on the first letter you \\nreceive stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. However, if you were paying a penalty \\nbefore joining our plan, you may not have another chance to request a review of that late \\nenrollment penalty.\\nSection 4.4 \\nIncome Related Monthly Adjustment Amount\\nSome members may be required to pay an extra charge, known as the Part D Income Related \\nMonthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. The extra charge is figured out using your \\nmodified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago. If this amount \\nis above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard premium amount and the additional IRMAA. For \\nmore information on the extra amount you may have to pay based on your income, visit\\nhttps://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/monthly-\\npremium-for-drug-plans.\\nIf you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter \\ntelling you what that extra amount will be. The extra amount will be withheld from your Social \\nSecurity, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefit check, no matter \\nhow you usually pay your plan premium, unless your monthly benefit isn’t enough to cover the \\nextra amount owed. If your benefit check isn’t enough to cover the extra amount, you will get a bill \\nfrom Medicare. You must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with your \\nmonthly plan premium. If you do not pay the extra amount you will be disenrolled from the plan and \\nlose prescription drug coverage.\\nIf you disagree about paying an extra amount, you can ask Social Security to review the decision. \\nTo find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY \\n1-800-325-0778).\\nSection 5 \\nMore information about your monthly premium\\nSection 5.1 \\nThere are several ways you can pay your plan premium\\nThere are four ways you can pay your plan premium.\\nOption 1: Paying by check\\nWe will send you a monthly bill for your monthly plan premium. Make your payment payable to \\nUnitedHealthcare. Please see your bill for the mailing address and other information. Include your \\nmember ID number on your check or money order. If making a payment for more than one \\nmember, include a payment slip for each member. Include the member ID number for each \\nmember on the check or money order.  All payments must be received on or before the due date \\nshown on the monthly bill. If you need your monthly bill replaced, please call Customer Service.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n11\\nOption 2: Electronic Funds Transfer \\nInstead of paying by check, you can have your monthly plan premium  automatically deducted from \\nyour checking account. Your monthly payment will be deducted around the 5th of each month. If \\nyou wish to sign up for Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), you may follow the instructions on your \\nmonthly bill, or you may call Customer Service.\\nOption 3: Paying by credit card\\nInstead of paying by check, you can pay your monthly plan premium  with your credit card. If you \\nwish to sign up to use your credit card to pay your monthly plan premium  please call Customer \\nService.\\nOption 4: Having your plan premium  taken out of your monthly Social Security check\\nChanging the way you pay your premium. If you decide to change the way you pay your \\npremium, it can take up to three months for your new payment method to take effect. While we are \\nprocessing your request for a new payment method, you are responsible for making sure that your \\nplan premium is paid on time. Please contact Customer Service to notify us of your premium \\npayment option choice or if you’d like to change your existing option. (You can find our phone \\nnumber on the cover of this booklet.)\\nWhat to do if you are having trouble paying your plan premium \\nYour plan premium is due in our office by the first day of the month. If we have not received your \\npayment by the first day of the month, we will send you a delinquency notice. In addition, we have \\nthe right to pursue collection of these premium  amounts you owe.\\nIf you are having trouble paying your premium on time, please contact Customer Service to see if \\nwe can direct you to programs that will help with your costs.\\nIf we end your membership because you did not pay your  plan premium, you will have health \\ncoverage under Original Medicare.As long as you are receiving “Extra Help” with your prescription \\ndrug costs, you will continue to have Part D drug coverage. Medicare will enroll you into a new \\nprescription drug plan for your Part D coverage.  \\nAt the time we end your membership, you may still owe us for premiums you have not paid. We \\nhave the right to pursue collection of the premiums you owe. If you request enrollment in one of our \\nplans and have unpaid premiums in a current or prior plan of ours, we have the right to require \\npayment of any premium amounts you owe, before allowing you to enroll.\\nIf you think we have wrongfully ended your membership, you can make a complaint (also called a \\ngrievance); see Chapter 9 for how to file a complaint. If you had an emergency circumstance that \\nwas out of your control and it caused you to not be able to pay your premiums within our grace \\nperiod, you can make a complaint. For complaints, we will review our decision again. Chapter 9, \\nSection 11 of this document tells how to make a complaint or you can call us at 1-866-480-1086 \\nbetween 8 a.m.-8 p.m. local time, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 711. You must make your \\nrequest no later than 60 days after the date your membership ends. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n12\\nSection 5.2 \\nCan we change your monthly plan premium during the year?\\nNo. We are not allowed to change the amount we charge for the plan’s monthly plan premium \\nduring the year. If the monthly plan premium changes for next year we will tell you in September \\nand the change will take effect on January 1.\\nHowever, in some cases the part of the premium that you have to pay can change during the year. \\nThis happens if you become eligible for the “Extra Help” program or if you lose your eligibility for \\nthe “Extra Help” program during the year. If a member qualifies for “Extra Help” with their \\nprescription drug costs, the “Extra Help” program will pay all or part of the member’s monthly plan \\npremium. If Medicare pays only a portion of this premium, we will bill you for the amount Medicare \\ndoesn’t cover. A member who loses their eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full \\nmonthly premium. You can find out more about the “Extra Help” program in Chapter 2, Section 7.\\nSection 6 \\nKeeping your plan membership record up to date\\nYour membership record has information from your enrollment form, including  your address and \\ntelephone number. It shows your specific plan coverage including your Primary Care Provider.\\nThe doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and other providers in the plan’s network need to have correct \\ninformation about you. These network providers use your membership record to know what \\nservices and drugs are covered and the cost-sharing amounts for you. Because of this, it is very \\nimportant that you help us keep your information up to date.\\nLet us know about these changes:\\n· Changes to your name, your address, or your phone number.\\n· Changes in any other  medical or drug insurance coverage you have (such as from your \\nemployer, your spouse’s employer, Workers’ Compensation, or Medicaid).\\n· If you have any liability claims, such as claims from an automobile accident.\\n· If you have been admitted to a nursing home.\\n· If you receive care in an out-of-area or out-of-network hospital or emergency room.\\n· If your designated responsible party (such as a caregiver) changes.\\n· If you are participating in a clinical research study. (Note: You are not required to tell your plan \\nabout the clinical research studies you intend to participate in but we encourage you to do so)\\nIf any of this information changes, please let us know by calling Customer Service.\\nIt is also important to contact Social Security if you move or change your mailing address. You can \\nfind phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in Chapter 2, Section 5.\\nSection 7 \\nHow other insurance works with our plan\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 1: Getting started as a member\\n13\\nOther insurance\\nMedicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or drug insurance \\ncoverage that you have. That’s because we must coordinate any other coverage you have with your \\nbenefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of Benefits.\\nOnce each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance coverage \\nthat we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct, you don’t need to do \\nanything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other coverage that is not listed, please call \\nCustomer Service. You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once \\nyou have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time.\\nWhen you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules set by \\nMedicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays \\nfirst is called the “primary payer” and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays \\nsecond, called the “secondary payer,” only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary \\ncoverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. If you have other \\ninsurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy.\\nThese rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage:\\n· If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first.\\n· If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member’s current employment, \\nwho pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and \\nwhether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD):\\n° If you’re under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your group \\nhealth plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in \\na multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees.\\n° If you’re over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health plan pays first if \\nthe employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan \\nthat has more than 20 employees.\\n· If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 \\nmonths after you become eligible for Medicare.\\nThese types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type:\\n· No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance)\\n· Liability (including automobile insurance)\\n· Black lung benefits\\n· Workers’ Compensation\\nAlabama Medicaid (Medicaid) and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare-covered services. They \\nonly pay after Medicare and/or employer group health plans have paid.\\n\\n\\nChapter 2\\nChapter 2: Important phone numbers and resources\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 2: Important phone numbers and resources\\n15\\nSection 1 \\nUnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) \\nContacts (how to contact us, including how to reach \\nCustomer Service)\\nHow to contact our plan’s Customer Service\\nFor assistance with claims, billing, or UnitedHealthcare member ID card questions, please call or \\nwrite to our plan Customer Service.

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the \\nmedical treatments, services, equipment, prescription drugs, and other medical care that are \\ncovered by the plan. \\nFor the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get \\nthis care, use the benefits chart in the next chapter, Chapter 4 (Medical Benefits Chart, what is \\ncovered and what you pay).\\nSection 1.1 \\nWhat are “network providers” and “covered services”? \\n· “Providers” are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide \\nmedical services and care. The term “providers” also includes hospitals and other health care \\nfacilities.\\n· “Network providers” are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, \\nhospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our \\npayment and your cost-sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these \\nproviders to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network bill \\nus directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your share of \\nthe cost for covered services.\\n· “Covered services” include all the medical care, health care services, supplies, equipment, \\nand prescription drugs that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care \\nare listed in the benefits chart in Chapter 4. Your covered services for prescription drugs are \\ndiscussed in Chapter 5.\\nSection 1.2 \\nBasic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan\\nAs a Medicare and Medicaid health plan, UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) \\nmust cover all services covered by Original Medicare and may offer other services in addition to \\nthose covered under Original Medicare as noted in Chapter 4.\\nThe plan will generally cover your medical care as long as:\\n· The care you receive is included in the plan’s Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in \\nChapter 4 of this document).\\n· The care you receive is considered medically necessary. “Medically necessary” means that \\nthe services, supplies, equipment, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or \\ntreatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.\\n· You have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your \\ncare. As a member of our plan, you must choose a  network PCP (for more information about \\nthis, see Section 2.1 in this chapter).\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n32\\n· You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see \\nSection 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-network provider (a \\nprovider who is not part of our plan’s network) will not be covered. This means you will have to \\npay the provider in full for the services furnished. Here are three exceptions:\\n° The plan covers emergency care or urgently needed services that you get from an out-of-\\nnetwork provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently \\nneeded services means, see Section 3 in this chapter.\\n° If you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover but there are no specialists \\nin our network that provide this care, you can get this care from an out-of-network provider at \\nthe same cost sharing you normally pay in-network. In this situation, we will cover these \\nservices as if you got the care from a network provider. You must get approval from us \\nbefore you start receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Please contact Customer \\nService, or have your PCP or the out-of-network provider call us to get approval (phone \\nnumbers are printed on the cover of this booklet).\\n° The plan covers kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare-certified dialysis facility \\nwhen you are temporarily outside the plan’s service area or when your provider for this \\nservice is temporarily unavailable of inaccessible. The cost sharing you pay the plan for \\ndialysis can never exceed the cost sharing in Original Medicare. If you are outside the plan\\'s \\nservice area and obtain the dialysis from a provider that is outside the plan\\'s network, your \\ncost sharing cannot exceed the cost sharing you pay in-network. However, if your usual in-\\nnetwork provider for dialysis is temporarily unavailable and you choose to obtain services \\ninside the service area from a provider outside the plan\\'s network the cost sharing for the \\ndialysis may be higher.\\nWhile you are a member of our Point of Service (POS) plan you may use either network providers or \\nout-of-network providers for covered routine dental services. Please see Ch. 3, Sec. 2.3.\\nSection 2 \\nUsing network and out-of-network providers to get your \\nmedical care\\nSection 2.1 \\nYou must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and \\noversee your medical care\\nWhat is a “PCP” and what does the PCP do for you?\\nWhat is a PCP?\\nA Primary Care Provider (PCP) is a network physician who is selected by you to provide and \\ncoordinate your covered services.\\nWhat types of providers may act as a PCP? \\nPCPs are generally physicians specializing in Internal Medicine, Family Practice or General \\nPractice.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n33\\nWhat is the role of my PCP?\\nYour relationship with your PCP is an important one because your PCP is responsible for the \\ncoordination of your health care and is also responsible for your routine health care needs. You \\nmay want to ask your PCP for assistance in selecting a network specialist and follow-up with your \\nPCP after any specialist visits. It is important for you to develop and maintain a relationship with \\nyour PCP.\\nHow do you choose your PCP?\\nYou must select a PCP from the Provider Directory at the time of your enrollment. You may, \\nhowever, visit any network provider you choose.\\nFor a copy of the most recent Provider Directory, or for help in selecting a PCP, call Customer \\nService or visit the website listed in Chapter 2 of this booklet for the most up-to-date information \\nabout our network providers.\\nIf you do not select a PCP at the time of enrollment, we may pick one for you. You may change \\nyour PCP at any time. See “Changing your PCP” below.\\nChanging your PCP\\nYou may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it’s possible that your PCP might leave \\nour plan’s network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP.\\nIf you want to change your PCP, call Customer Service or go online. If the PCP is accepting \\nadditional plan members, the change will become effective on the first day of the following month. \\nYou will receive a new UnitedHealthcare member ID card that shows this change.\\nSection 2.2 \\nHow to get care from specialists and other network providers\\nA specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. \\nThere are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples:\\n· Oncologists care for patients with cancer.\\n· Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions.\\n· Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions.\\nIf you use an out-of-network provider for routine dental services, your share of the costs for your \\ncovered services are described in \"Covered Routine Dental Benefits\" in Chapter 4.\\nEven though your PCP is trained to handle the majority of common health care needs, there may \\nbe a time when you feel that you need to see a network specialist. You do not need a referral from \\nyour PCP to see a network specialist or behavioral/mental health provider. Although you do not \\nneed a referral from your PCP to see a network specialist, your PCP can recommend an \\nappropriate network specialist for your medical condition, answer questions you have regarding a \\nnetwork specialist’s treatment plan and provide follow-up health care as needed. For coordination \\nof care, we recommend you notify your PCP when you see a network specialist.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n34\\nPlease refer to the Provider Directory for a listing of plan specialists available through your \\nnetwork, or you may consult the Provider Directory online at the website listed in Chapter 2 of this \\nbooklet.\\nWhat if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan?\\nIt is important that you know that we may make changes to the hospitals, doctors, and specialists \\n(providers) that are part of your plan during the year. If your doctor or specialist does leave your \\nplan you have certain rights and protections that are summarized below:\\n· Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we \\nfurnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists.\\n· We will make a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days’ notice that your provider \\nis leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider.\\n· We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care \\nneeds.\\n· If you are undergoing medical treatment you have the right to request, and we will work with \\nyou to ensure that the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted.\\n· If our network does not have a qualified specialist for a plan-covered service, we must cover \\nthat service at in-network cost sharing.\\n· If you believe we have not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous \\nprovider or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file a \\nquality of care complaint to the QIO, a quality of care grievance to the plan, or both. Please see \\nChapter 9.\\n· If you find out that your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can \\nassist you in finding a new provider to manage your care.\\nIf you are considering hospice, you (or your family or caregiver) can choose to have a pre-hospice \\nconsultation with a member from our Hospice Care Navigator team. They can talk with you about \\nyour hospice care options and help you find a hospice provider in or out-of-network. Choosing \\nhospice usually means you no longer want treatment for your terminal condition and want to \\nreceive palliative or comfort care instead. If you select a network hospice provider, you may be able \\nto continue your treatment plan for your terminal condition (with network providers) while also \\nreceiving palliative care from network hospice providers. This is called transitional concurrent care. \\nIf you select an out-of-network hospice provider, transitional concurrent care is unavailable.\\nYou may call Customer Service for assistance at the number listed in Chapter 2 of this booklet.\\nSome services require prior authorization from the plan in order to be covered. Obtaining prior \\nauthorization is the responsibility of the PCP or treating provider. Services and items requiring prior \\nauthorization are listed in Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1.\\nSection 2.3 \\nHow to get care from out-of-network providers\\nAs a member of our plan, you can choose to receive care from out-of-network providers for routine \\ndental services only. For more information see the \"Covered Routine Dental Benefits\" in Chapter \\n4. Otherwise, care that you receive from out-of-network providers will not be covered unless the \\ncare meets one of the three exceptions described in Section 1.2 of this chapter. For information \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n35\\nabout getting out-of-network care when you have a medical emergency or urgent need for care, \\nplease see Section 3 in this chapter.\\nSection 3 \\nHow to get services when you have an emergency or urgent \\nneed for care or during a disaster\\nSection 3.1 \\nGetting care if you have a medical emergency\\nWhat is a “medical emergency” and what should you do if you have one?\\nA “medical emergency” is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge \\nof health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical \\nattention to prevent your loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), \\nloss of a limb or function of a limb, or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The \\nmedical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly \\ngetting worse.\\nIf you have a medical emergency:\\n· Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or \\nhospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral first \\nfrom your PCP. You do not need to use a network doctor. You may get covered emergency \\nmedical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the world. \\nWhat is covered if you have a medical emergency?\\nOur plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any \\nother way could endanger your health. We also cover medical services during the emergency.\\nThe doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the \\nmedical emergency is over.\\nAfter the emergency is over you are entitled to follow-up care to be sure your condition continues to \\nbe stable. Your doctors will continue to treat you until your doctors contact us and make plans for \\nadditional care. Your follow-up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided \\nby out-of-network providers, we will try to arrange for network providers to take over your care as \\nsoon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow.\\nWhat if it wasn’t a medical emergency?\\nSometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in \\nfor emergency care – thinking that your health is in serious danger – and the doctor may say that it \\nwasn’t a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you \\nreasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care.\\nHowever, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only \\nif you get the additional care in one of these two ways:\\n· You go to a network provider to get the additional care. \\n· --or-- The additional care you get is considered “urgently needed services” and you follow the \\nrules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below).\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n36\\nSection 3.2 \\nGetting care when you have an urgent need for services\\nWhat are “urgently needed services”?\\nAn urgently needed service is a non-emergency situation requiring immediate medical care but, \\ngiven your circumstances, it is not possible or not reasonable to obtain these services from a \\nnetwork provider. The plan must cover urgently needed services provided out-of-network. Some \\nexamples of urgently needed services are i) a severe sore throat that occurs over the weekend or ii) \\nan unforeseen flare-up of a known condition when you are temporarily outside the service area.\\nYou should always try to obtain urgently needed services from network providers. However, if \\nproviders are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible and it is not reasonable to wait to obtain care \\nfrom your network provider when the network becomes available, we will cover urgently needed \\nservices that you get from an out-of-network provider. Check your Provider Directory for a list of \\nnetwork Urgent Care Centers.\\nOur plan covers worldwide emergency and urgently needed services outside the United States \\nunder the following circumstances: emergency services, including emergency or urgently needed \\ncare and emergency ambulance transportation from the scene of an emergency to the nearest \\nmedical treatment facility. Transportation back to the United States from another country is not \\ncovered. Pre-scheduled, pre-planned treatments (including dialysis for an ongoing condition) and/\\nor elective procedures are not covered.\\nSection 3.3 \\nGetting care during a disaster\\nIf the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of \\nthe United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still \\nentitled to care from your plan.\\nPlease visit the following website: myUHCMedicare.com for information on how to obtain needed \\ncare during a disaster.\\nIf you cannot use a network provider during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care from \\nout-of-network providers at in-network cost-sharing. If you cannot use a network pharmacy during a \\ndisaster, you may be able to fill your prescription drugs at an out-of-network pharmacy. Please see \\nChapter 5, Section 2.5 for more information.\\nSection 4 \\nWhat if you are billed directly for the full cost of your \\nservices?\\nSection 4.1 \\nYou can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services\\nIf you have paid more than your plan cost-sharing for covered services, or if you have received a bill \\nfor the full cost of covered medical services, go to Chapter 7 (Asking us to pay our share of a bill \\nyou have received for covered medical services or drugs) for information about what to do.\\nSection 4.2 \\nWhat should you do if services are not covered by our plan?\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n37\\nOur plan covers all medically necessary services as listed in the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter \\n4 of this document. If you receive services not covered by our plan or services obtained out-of-\\nnetwork and were not authorized, you are responsible for paying the full cost of services. However, \\nbefore paying for the cost of the service, contact your state Medicaid office to find out if the service \\nis covered by Medicaid.\\nFor covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you get \\nafter you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service. For example, if your plan \\ncovers one routine physical exam per year and you receive that routine physical but choose to have \\na second routine physical within the same year, you pay the full cost of the second routine physical. \\nAny amounts that you pay after you have reached the benefit limitation do not count toward your \\nannual out-of-pocket maximum. (See Chapter 4 for more information on your plan’s out-of-pocket \\nmaximum.)\\nSection 5 \\nHow are your medical services covered when you are in a \\n“clinical research study”?\\nSection 5.1 \\nWhat is a “clinical research study”?\\nA clinical research study (also called a “clinical trial”) is a way that doctors and scientists test new \\ntypes of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research studies are \\napproved by Medicare. Clinical research studies approved by Medicare typically request volunteers \\nto participate in the study.\\nOnce Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study will \\ncontact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the \\nscientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the \\nrequirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if \\nyou participate in the study.\\nIf you participate in a Medicare-approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the \\ncovered services you receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical \\ntrial, then you are only responsible for in-network cost sharing for the services in that trial. If you \\npaid more, for example, if you already paid the Original Medicare cost-sharing amount, we will \\nreimburse the difference between what you paid and the in-network cost sharing. However, you will \\nneed to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When you are in a clinical research \\nstudy, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is \\nnot related to the study) through our plan. \\nIf you want to participate in any Medicare-approved clinical research study, you do not need to tell \\nus or get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical \\nresearch study do not need to be part of our plan’s network of providers.\\nAlthough you do not need to get our plan’s permission to be in a clinical research study, we \\nencourage you to notify us in advance when you choose to participate in Medicare-qualified \\nclinical trials.\\nIf you participate in a study that Medicare has not approved you will be responsible for paying all \\ncosts for your participation in the study. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n38\\nSection 5.2 \\nWhen you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for what?\\nOnce you join a Medicare-approved clinical research study, Original Medicare covers the routine \\nitems and services you receive as part of the study, including:\\n· Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren’t in a study.\\n· An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study.\\n· Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care.\\nAfter Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will pay the difference \\nbetween the cost-sharing in Original Medicare and your in-network cost-sharing as a member of our \\nplan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as \\nyou would if you received these services from our plan. However, you are required to submit \\ndocumentation showing how much cost sharing you paid. Please see Chapter 7 for more \\ninformation for submitting requests for payments. \\nHere’s an example of how the cost-sharing works: Let’s say that you have a lab test that \\ncosts $100 as part of the research study. Let’s also say that your share of the costs for this test \\nis $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan’s benefits. In this \\ncase, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and you would pay the $20 copay required \\nunder Original Medicare. You would then notify your plan that you received a qualified clinical \\ntrial service and submit documentation such as a provider bill to the plan. The plan would then \\ndirectly pay you $10. Therefore, your net payment is $10, the same amount you would pay \\nunder our plan’s benefits. Please note that in order to receive payment from your plan, you \\nmust submit documentation to your plan such as a provider bill. \\nWhen you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of \\nthe following:\\n· Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless \\nMedicare would cover the item or service even if you were not in a study.\\n· Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For \\nexample, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your \\nmedical condition would normally require only one CT scan.\\nDo you want to know more?\\nYou can get more information about joining a clinical research study by visiting the Medicare \\nwebsite to read or download the publication “Medicare and Clinical Research Studies.” (The \\npublication is available at: www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical-Research-\\nStudies.pdf. ) You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \\nTTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.\\nSection 6 \\nRules for getting care in a “religious non-medical health care \\ninstitution”\\nSection 6.1 \\nWhat is a religious non-medical health care institution?\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n39\\nA religious non-medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that \\nwould ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a \\nskilled nursing facility is against a member’s religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for \\ncare in a religious non-medical health care institution. This benefit is provided only for Part A \\ninpatient services (non-medical health care services).\\nSection 6.2 \\nReceiving Care From a Religious Non-medical Health Care Institution\\nTo get care from a religious non-medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document \\nthat says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is “non-excepted.”\\n· “Non-excepted” medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary \\nand not required by any federal, state, or local law. \\n· “Excepted” medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or \\nis required under federal, state, or local law.\\nTo be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non-medical health care institution \\nmust meet the following conditions:\\n· The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare.\\n· Our plan’s coverage of services you receive is limited to non-religious aspects of care.\\n· If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following \\nconditions apply:\\n° You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for \\ninpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care.\\n° –  and – you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the \\nfacility or your stay will not be covered.\\nYou are covered for unlimited days in the hospital, as long as your stay meets Medicare coverage \\nguidelines. The coverage limits are described under Inpatient Hospital Care in the Medical \\nBenefits Chart in Chapter 4.\\nSection 7 \\nRules for ownership of durable medical equipment\\nSection 7.1 \\nWill you own the durable medical equipment after making a certain \\nnumber of payments under our plan?\\nDurable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, \\nwheelchairs, walkers, powered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating \\ndevices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the \\nhome. The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we discuss \\nother types of DME that you must rent.\\nIn Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying \\ncopayments for the item for 13 months. As a member of our plan, however, you usually will not \\nacquire ownership of rented DME items no matter how many copayments you make for the item \\nwhile a member of our plan, even if you made up to 12 consecutive payments for the DME item \\nunder Original Medicare before you joined our plan. Under certain limited circumstances we will \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 3: Using the plan for your medical services\\n40\\ntransfer ownership of the durable medical equipment item. Call Customer Service for more \\ninformation.\\nWhat happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original \\nMedicare?\\nIf you did not acquire ownership of the DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new \\nconsecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. The \\npayments made while enrolled in your plan do not count.\\nExample 1: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then \\njoined our plan. The payments you made in Original Medicare do not count. \\nExample 2: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then \\njoined our plan. You were in our plan but did not obtain ownership while in our plan. You then go \\nback to Original Medicare. You will have to make 13 consecutive new payments to own the item \\nonce you join Original Medicare again. All previous payments (whether to our plan or to Original \\nMedicare) do not count. \\nSection 7.2 \\nRules for oxygen equipment, supplies, and maintenance\\nWhat oxygen benefits are you entitled to?\\nIf you qualify for Medicare oxygen equipment coverage our plan will cover:\\n· Rental of oxygen equipment\\n· Delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents\\n· Tubing and related oxygen accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents\\n· Maintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment\\nIf you leave our plan or no longer medically require oxygen equipment, then the oxygen equipment \\nmust be returned.\\nWhat happens if you leave your plan and return to Original Medicare?\\nOriginal Medicare requires an oxygen supplier to provide you services for five years. During the first \\n36 months you rent the equipment. The remaining 24 months the supplier provides the equipment \\nand maintenance (you are still responsible for the copayment for oxygen). After five years you may \\nchoose to stay with the same company or go to another company. At this point, the five-year cycle \\nbegins again, even if you remain with the same company, requiring you to pay copayments for the \\nfirst 36 months. If you join or leave our plan, the five-year cycle starts over. \\n\\n\\nChapter 4\\nChapter 4: Medical Benefits \\nChart  (what is covered and what \\nyou pay)\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n42\\nSection 1 \\nUnderstanding your out-of-pocket costs for covered \\nservices\\nThis chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart that lists your covered services and shows how \\nmuch you will pay for each covered service as a member of UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® \\n(HMO-POS D-SNP). Later in this chapter, you can find information about medical services that are \\nnot covered. It also explains limits on certain services.\\nSection 1.1 \\nTypes of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services\\nTo understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the \\ntypes of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services. \\n· The “deductible” is the amount you must pay for certain medical services before our plan \\nbegins to pay its share. Section 1.2 tells you more about your plan deductible.\\n· A “copayment” is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. \\nYou pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in \\nSection 2 tells you more about your copayments.)\\n· “Coinsurance” is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay \\na coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 \\ntells you more about your coinsurance.)\\nQMB members - you do not have any costs for Medicare-covered services, except your \\nprescription copayments if you are enrolled in Medicare as a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary \\n(QMB) and Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid). Your coinsurance, deductibles and copayments \\n(except for Part D prescription drugs) are paid by Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid).\\nNon-QMB members - you may have costs if Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)  does not cover cost-\\nsharing for non-QMB enrollees. Your costs may include premiums, deductibles, copayments and \\ncoinsurance.\\nShow your UnitedHealthcare member ID card and your state Medicaid ID card  when getting health \\ncare services. These cards will help your health care providers coordinate payment.\\nCall Customer Service at the telephone number listed in Chapter 2 of this booklet if:\\n· you are asked to pay for covered services, \\n· your provider will not see you or \\n· you have other questions\\nIf you receive notice that your Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)  coverage has expired, please call \\nyour Medicaid office right away to reapply for assistance.

During the 6 month period, if you do go to your provider, you will \\nhave out-of-pocket costs that your Medicare plan will not cover, you will be responsible for those \\ncosts until you regain your Medicaid eligibility. Your out-of-pocket costs may include Medicare plan \\ndeductibles, copayments and coinsurance up to the Original Medicare amounts, which can be \\nfound at www.medicare.gov. In addition, you will need to pay the plan premium previously covered \\nby Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) . If you receive services during this time, you will be responsible \\nfor up to $8,300 in-network for applicable Medicare-covered services. Out-of-network services do \\nnot count toward this. Please call Customer Service (phone numbers are printed on the cover of \\nthis booklet) for additional information related to out-of-pocket costs during the grace period.\\nIf you do not re-enroll in Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) during the 6 month period, you will be \\ndisenrolled from our plan. You will be enrolled in Original Medicare. \\nNon-QMB members - your cost-sharing will not change during the 6 month period. You may have \\nout-of-pocket costs if Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)  does not cover cost-sharing for non-QMB \\nenrollees. Your out-of-pocket costs may include premiums, deductibles, copayments and \\ncoinsurance.\\nSection 1.2 \\nWhat is your plan deductible?\\nYour deductible is $233. Until you have paid the deductible amount, you must pay the full cost of \\nyour covered services. Once you have paid your deductible, we will begin to pay our share of the \\ncosts for covered medical services and you will pay your copayment or coinsurance amount for the \\nrest of the calendar year.\\nThe deductible applies only to certain services. This means that we will pay our share of the costs \\nfor these services only after you have paid the full amount of your deductible. The deductible does \\nnot apply to any Medicare-covered services provided at a Federally Qualified Health Center \\n(FQHC). The deductible applies to the following services:\\n· Acupuncture for chronic low back pain – Medicare-covered\\n· Ambulance Services\\n· Cardiac Rehabilitation Services\\n· Chiropractic Services – Medicare-covered\\n· Diabetes Monitoring Supplies\\n· Diabetes Therapeutic Shoes or Inserts\\n· Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Related Supplies\\n· Medicare Part B prescription drugs, including chemotherapy drugs\\n· Opioid Treatment Services\\n· Outpatient Diagnostics – X-rays\\n· Outpatient Diagnostics – Radiation Therapy (including supplies)\\n· Outpatient Diagnostics – Lab Services\\n· Blood\\n· Outpatient Diagnostics – Non-radiological Diagnostic Services\\n· Outpatient Diagnostics – Radiological Diagnostic Services, Not Including X-Rays, excluding \\ndiagnostic mammogram\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n44\\n· Outpatient Mental Health Care – Individual and Group Therapy Sessions\\n· Outpatient Rehabilitation Services – Physical and Speech-Language Therapy\\n· Outpatient Rehabilitation Services – Occupational Therapy\\n· Outpatient Substance Abuse Services\\n· Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC), excluding diagnostic colonoscopy\\n· Outpatient Hospital Services, excluding diagnostic colonoscopy\\n· Outpatient Hospital Observation Services\\n· Partial Hospitalization Services\\n· Primary Care Provider\\n· Specialist\\n· Hearing and Balance Exams – Medicare-covered\\n· Non-routine Dental Care – Medicare-covered\\n· Podiatry Services – Medicare-covered\\n· Prosthetic Devices and Related Supplies\\n· Pulmonary Rehabilitation Services\\n· Outpatient Dialysis Treatments (Kidney)\\n· Supervised Exercise Therapy (SET)\\n· Vision Care – Medicare-covered eye exams to evaluate for eye disease\\n· Vision Care – eyeglasses or contact lenses after cataract surgery\\nSection 1.3 \\nWhat is the most you will pay for Medicare Part A and Part B covered \\nmedical services?\\nNote: Because our members also get assistance from Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid), very few \\nmembers ever reach this out-of-pocket maximum.\\nBecause you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit on the amount you have to \\npay out-of-pocket each year for in-network medical services that are covered under Medicare Part A \\nand Part B. This limit is called the maximum out-of-pocket amount for medical services. For \\ncalendar year 2023 this amount is $8,300.\\nThe amounts you pay for your deductibles, copayments and coinsurance for in-network covered \\nservices count toward this maximum out-of-pocket amount. The amounts you pay for your plan \\npremium and the amounts you pay for your Part D prescription drugs do not count toward your \\nmaximum out-of-pocket amount. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count \\ntoward your maximum out-of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the \\nMedical Benefits Chart. If you reach the maximum out-of-pocket amount of $8,300, you will not \\nhave to pay any out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for in-network covered Part A and Part B \\nservices. However, you must continue to pay your plan premium and the Medicare Part B premium \\n(unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)  or another third \\nparty).\\nSection 1.4 \\nOur plan does not allow network providers to “balance bill” you\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n45\\nAs a member of UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP), an important protection for \\nyou is that, after you meet any deductibles,  you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when \\nyou get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add additional separate charges, called \\n“balance billing.” This protection applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges \\nfor a service and even if there is a dispute and we don’t pay certain provider charges. \\nHere is how this protection works.\\n· If your cost-sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00) then you pay \\nonly that amount for any covered services from a network provider. \\n· If your cost-sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay \\nmore than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see:\\n° If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance \\npercentage multiplied by the plan’s reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract \\nbetween the provider and the plan).\\n° If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates with \\nMedicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for \\nparticipating providers. \\n° If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who does not participate \\nwith Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate \\nfor non-participating providers. \\n· If you believe a provider has “balance billed” you, call Customer Service.\\nSection 2 \\nUse the Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered \\nand how much you will pay\\nSection 2.1 \\nYour medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan\\nThe Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services UnitedHealthcare Dual \\nComplete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) covers and what you pay out-of-pocket for each service. Part D \\nprescription drug coverage is covered in Chapter 5. The services listed in the Medical Benefits \\nChart are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met:\\n· Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines \\nestablished by Medicare.\\n· Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment, and Part B prescription \\ndrugs) must be medically necessary. “Medically necessary” means that the services, supplies, \\nor drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and \\nmeet accepted standards of medical practice.\\n· You receive your care from a network provider. In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-\\nnetwork provider will not be covered, unless it is emergent or urgent care or unless your plan \\nor a network provider has given you a referral. This means that you will have to pay the provider \\nin full for the services furnished.\\n· You have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. \\n· Some of the services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only if your doctor or \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 4: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n46\\nother network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called “prior authorization”) from \\nus.\\n° Covered services that may need approval in advance to be covered as in-network services \\nare marked in italics in the Medical Benefits Chart.\\n° Network providers agree by contract to obtain prior authorization from the plan and agree to \\nnot balance bill you.\\nOther important things to know about our coverage:\\n· You are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare covers health care and \\nprescription drugs. Medicaid covers your cost-sharing for Medicare services.

However, if you also are treated or monitored for an existing \\nmedical condition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will \\napply for the care received for the existing medical condition. \\n· If Medicare adds coverage for any new services during 2023, either Medicare or our plan will \\ncover those services.\\n· If you are within our plan’s 6-month period of deemed continued eligibility, we will continue to \\nprovide all appropriate Medicare Advantage plan Medicare covered benefits. However, during \\nthis period, we will not continue to cover Medicaid benefits that are included under the \\nMedicaid State Plan, nor will we pay the Medicare premiums or cost sharing for which the state \\nwould otherwise be liable. \\n· Medicare approved UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) to provide these \\nbenefits and/or lower copayments/coinsurance as part of the Value-Based Insurance Design \\nprogram.

Please see Chapter 4 for \\nMedicare Part B drug benefits and hospice drug benefits.\\nIn addition to the drugs covered by Medicare, some prescription drugs are covered for you under \\nyour Medicaid benefits. You can learn more about prescription drug coverage under your Medicaid \\nbenefits by contacting your Medicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) listed in Chapter \\n2 of this booklet. Your Medicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) may also be able to \\nprovide a Medicaid Drug List that tells you how to find out which drugs are covered under \\nMedicaid.\\nSection 1.1 \\nBasic rules for the plan’s Part D drug coverage\\nThe plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:\\n· You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist, or other prescriber) write you a prescription which \\nmust be valid under applicable state law.\\n· Your prescriber must not be on Medicare’s Exclusion or Preclusion Lists.\\n· You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 2, Fill your \\nprescriptions at a network pharmacy or through the plan’s mail-order service.)\\n· Your drug must be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) (we call it the “Drug List” \\nfor short). (See Section 3, Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List”.)\\n· Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A “medically accepted indication” \\nis a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported \\nby certain reference books. (See Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted \\nindication.)\\nSection 2 \\nFill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through the \\nplan’s mail-order service\\nSection 2.1 \\nUse a network pharmacy\\nIn most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at the plan’s network \\npharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at out-\\nof-network pharmacies.)\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n114\\nA network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered \\nprescription drugs. The term “covered drugs” means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are on \\nthe plan’s Drug List. \\nSection 2.2 \\nNetwork pharmacies\\nHow do you find a network pharmacy in your area?\\nTo find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Pharmacy Directory, visit our website \\n(myUHCMedicare.com), and/or call Customer Service.\\nYou may go to any of our network pharmacies.\\nWhat if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network?\\nIf the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find a new \\npharmacy that is in the network. To find another pharmacy in your area, you can get help from \\nCustomer Service or use the Pharmacy Directory. You can also find information on our website at \\nmyUHCMedicare.com.\\nWhat if you need a specialized pharmacy?\\nSome prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include:\\n· Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy. \\n· Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care (LTC) facility. Usually, a LTC \\nfacility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you have any difficulty accessing \\nyour Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please contact Customer Service.\\n· Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program (not \\navailable in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives have \\naccess to these pharmacies in our network. \\n· Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain locations or that \\nrequire special handling, provider coordination, or education on their use. (Note: This scenario \\nshould happen rarely.)\\nTo locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Pharmacy Directory or call Customer Service.\\nSection 2.3 \\nUsing the plan’s mail-order service\\nOur plan’s mail-order service allows you to order up to a 100-day supply.\\nTo get order forms and information about filling your prescriptions by mail, please reference your \\nPharmacy Directory to find the mail service pharmacies in our network. If you use a mail-order \\npharmacy not in the plan’s network, your prescription will not be covered.\\nUsually a mail-order pharmacy order will be delivered to you in no more than 10 business days. \\nHowever, sometimes your mail-order may be delayed. If your mail-order is delayed, please follow \\nthese steps:\\nIf your prescription is on file at your local pharmacy, go to your pharmacy to fill the prescription. If \\nyour delayed prescription is not on file at your local pharmacy, then please ask your doctor to call \\nin a new prescription to your pharmacist. Or, your pharmacist can call the doctor’s office for you to \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n115\\nrequest the prescription. Your pharmacist can call the Pharmacy help desk at 1-877-889-6510, \\n(TTY) 711, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if he/she has any problems, questions, concerns, or \\nneeds a claim override for a delayed prescription.\\nNew prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor’s office. \\nThe pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it receives from health care \\nproviders, without checking with you first, if either: \\n· You used mail-order services with this plan in the past, or \\n· You sign up for automatic delivery of all new prescriptions received directly from health care \\nproviders. You may request automatic delivery of all new prescriptions at any time by phone or \\nmail.\\nIf you receive a prescription automatically by mail that you do not want, and you were not \\ncontacted to see if you wanted it before it shipped, you may be eligible for a refund. \\nIf you used mail order in the past and do not want the pharmacy to automatically fill and ship each \\nnew prescription, please contact us by phone or mail. \\nIf you have never used our mail-order delivery and/or decide to stop automatic fills of new \\nprescriptions, the pharmacy will contact you each time it gets a new prescription from a health care \\nprovider to see if you want the medication filled and shipped immediately. It is important that you \\nrespond each time you are contacted by the pharmacy, to let them know whether to ship, delay, or \\ncancel the new prescription. \\nRefills on mail-order prescriptions. For refills, please contact your pharmacy at least 10 business \\ndays before your current prescription will run out to make sure your next order is shipped to you in \\ntime. You also have the option to sign up for an automatic refill program. Under this program we \\nwill start to process your next refill automatically when our records show you should be close to \\nrunning out of your drug. The pharmacy will contact you prior to shipping each refill to make sure \\nyou are in need of more medication, and you can cancel scheduled refills if you have enough of \\nyour medication or if your medication has changed. To cancel the auto refill program,\\xa0please \\ncontact the\\xa0mail order pharmacy 10 days before your order will ship or you can let the pharmacy \\nknow when they notify you of an upcoming shipment.\\nPlease keep your mail order pharmacy informed about the best way(s) to contact you, so the \\npharmacy can reach you to confirm your order before shipping. You can do this by contacting the \\nmail order pharmacy when you set up your auto refill program and also when you receive \\nnotifications about upcoming refill shipments.\\nSection 2.4 \\nHow can you get a long-term supply of drugs?\\nWhen you get a long-term supply of drugs, your cost-sharing may be lower. The plan offers two \\nways to get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”) of “maintenance” drugs on our \\nplan’s Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or \\nlong-term medical condition.) \\n1. Some retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long-term supply of maintenance \\ndrugs. Your Pharmacy Directory tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a \\nlong-term supply of maintenance drugs. You can also call Customer Service for more \\ninformation.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n116\\n2. You may also receive maintenance drugs through our mail-order program. Please see Section \\n2.3 for more information.\\nSection 2.5 \\nWhen can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network?\\nYour prescription may be covered in certain situations\\nGenerally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only when you are not able to use a \\nnetwork pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside of our service area where \\nyou can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. Please check first with Customer \\nService to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. You will most likely be required to pay the \\ndifference between what you pay for the drug at the out-of-network pharmacy and the cost that we \\nwould cover at an in-network pharmacy.\\nHere are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out-of-network \\npharmacy:\\n· Prescriptions for a Medical Emergency\\nWe will cover prescriptions that are filled at an out-of-network pharmacy if the prescriptions are \\nrelated to care for a medical emergency or urgently needed care, are included in our Drug List \\nwithout restrictions, and are not excluded from Medicare Part D coverage.\\n· Coverage when traveling or out of the service area\\nWhen traveling within the U.S. you have access to network pharmacies nationwide. Bring your \\nprescriptions and medication with you and be sure to check the pharmacy directory for your \\ntravel plans to locate a network pharmacy while traveling. If you are leaving the country, you \\nmay be able to obtain a greater day supply to take with you before leaving for the country \\nwhere there are no network pharmacies available.\\n· If you are unable to obtain a covered drug in a timely manner within the service area because a \\nnetwork pharmacy that provides 24-hour service is not within reasonable driving distance.\\n· If you are trying to fill a prescription drug not regularly stocked at an accessible network retail \\nor  mail-order pharmacy (including high cost and unique drugs).\\n· If you need a prescription while a patient in an emergency department, provider based clinic, \\noutpatient surgery, or other outpatient setting.\\nHow do you ask for reimbursement from the plan?\\nIf you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather than \\nyour normal cost share) at the time you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse you for \\nour share of the cost. (Chapter 7, Section 2.1 explains how to ask the plan to pay you back.)\\nSection 3 \\nYour drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List”\\nSection 3.1 \\nThe “Drug List” tells which Part D drugs are covered\\nThe plan has a “List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).” In this Evidence of Coverage, we call it the \\n“Drug List” for short. \\nThe drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. \\nThe list meets Medicare’s requirements and has been approved by Medicare.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n117\\nThe Drug List includes the drugs covered under Medicare Part D. In addition to the drugs covered \\nby Medicare, some prescription drugs are covered for you under your Medicaid benefits. You can \\nlearn more about prescription drug coverage under your Medicaid benefits by contacting your \\nMedicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) listed in Chapter 2 of this booklet. Your \\nMedicaid health plan or Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) may also be able to provide a Medicaid \\nDrug List that tells you how to find out which drugs are covered under Medicaid.\\nWe will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the other coverage \\nrules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted indication. A \\n“medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is either: \\n· Approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis or condition for which it is \\nbeing prescribed.\\n· -- or -- Supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug \\nInformation and the DRUGDEX Information System.\\nThe Drug List includes brand name drugs and generic drugs.\\nA brand name drug is a prescription drug that is sold under a trademarked name owned by the \\ndrug manufacturer. Brand name drugs that are more complex than typical drugs (for example, \\ndrugs that are based on a protein) are called biological products. On the drug list, when we refer to \\n“drugs,” this could mean a drug or a biological product.\\nA generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. \\nGenerally, generics work just as well as the brand name drug and usually costs less. There are \\ngeneric drug substitutes available for many brand name drugs.\\nWhat is not on the Drug List?\\nThe plan does not cover all prescription drugs.\\n· In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for \\nmore information about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter).\\n· In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug List. In some \\ncases, you may be able to obtain a drug that is not on the drug list. For more information, \\nplease see Chapter 9.\\n· Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)-covered drugs may not be included on this plan’s Drug list. If \\nthis plan does not cover a specific drug, please check your Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) Drug \\nlist to see if the drug is covered.\\nSection 3.2 \\nHow can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List?\\nYou have three ways to find out:\\n1. Check the most recent Drug List we provided electronically.\\n2. Visit the plan’s website (myUHCMedicare.com). The Drug List on the website is always the \\nmost current.\\n3. Call Customer Service to find out if a particular drug is on the plan’s Drug List or to ask for a \\ncopy of the list.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n118\\nSection 4 \\nThere are restrictions on coverage for some drugs\\nSection 4.1 \\nWhy do some drugs have restrictions?\\nFor certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers them. A team of \\ndoctors and pharmacists developed these rules to encourage you and your provider to use drugs \\nin the most effective ways. To find out if any of these restrictions apply to a drug you take or want to \\ntake, check the Drug List. If a safe, lower-cost drug will work just as well medically as a higher-cost \\ndrug, the plan’s rules are designed to encourage you and your provider to use that lower-cost \\noption.\\nPlease note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once in our Drug List. This is because \\nthe same drugs can differ based on the strength, amount, or form of the drug prescribed by your \\nhealth care provider, and different restrictions or cost sharing may apply to the different versions of \\nthe drug (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg; one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid).\\nSection 4.2 \\nWhat kinds of restrictions?\\nThe sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain drugs.\\nIf there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider will have to \\ntake extra steps in order for us to cover the drug. Contact Customer Service to learn what you or \\nyour provider would need to do to get coverage for the drug. If you want us to waive the restriction \\nfor you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and ask us to make an exception. We \\nmay or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9)\\nWhat is a compounded drug? \\nA compounded drug is created by a pharmacist by combining or mixing ingredients to create a \\nprescription medication customized to the needs of an individual patient.  \\nDoes my Part D plan cover compounded drugs?\\nGenerally compounded drugs are non-formulary drugs (not covered) by your plan.  You may need \\nto ask for and receive an approved coverage determination from us to have your compounded \\ndrug covered.  Compounded drugs may be Part D eligible if they meet all of the following \\nrequirements: \\n1. Contains at least one FDA, or Compendia, approved drug ingredient, and all ingredients in the \\ncompound (including their intended route of administration) are supported in the Compendia.\\n2. Does not contain a non-FDA approved or Part D excluded drug ingredient\\n3. Does not contain an ingredient covered under Part B. (If it does, the compound may be \\ncovered under Part B rather than Part D)\\n4. Prescribed for a medically accepted condition\\nThe chart below explains the basic requirements for how a compound with 2 or more ingredients \\nmay or may not be covered under Part D rules, as well as potential costs to you.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n119\\nCompound Type\\nMedicare Coverage\\nCompound containing a Part B eligible \\ningredient\\nCompound is covered only by Part B\\nCompound containing all ingredients eligible \\nfor Part D coverage and all ingredients are \\napproved for use in a compound\\nCompound may be covered by Part D upon \\napproved coverage determination\\nCompound containing ingredients eligible for \\nPart D coverage and approved for use in a \\ncompound, and ingredients excluded from \\nPart D coverage (for example, over the counter \\ndrugs, etc.)\\nCompound may be covered by Part D upon \\napproved coverage determination.  However, \\nthe ingredients excluded from Part D \\ncoverage will not be covered and you are not \\nresponsible for the cost of those ingredients \\nexcluded from Part D coverage\\nCompound containing an ingredient not \\napproved or supported for use in a compound\\nCompound is not covered by Part D.  You are \\nresponsible for the entire cost\\nWhat do I have to pay for a covered compounded drug?\\nA compounded drug that is Part D eligible may require an approved coverage determination to be \\ncovered by your plan.\\nGetting plan approval in advance\\nFor certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we will agree to \\ncover the drug for you. This is called “prior authorization.” This is put in place to ensure \\nmedication safety and help guide appropriate use of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, \\nyour drug might not be covered by the plan.\\nTrying a different drug first\\nThis requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs before the \\nplan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition and \\nDrug A is less costly, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, \\nthe plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called “step \\ntherapy.”\\nQuantity limits\\nFor certain drugs, we limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription. For \\nexample, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we may \\nlimit coverage for your prescription to no more than one pill per day.\\nSection 5 \\nWhat if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you’d like \\nit to be covered?\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n120\\nSection 5.1 \\nThere are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way \\nyou’d like it to be covered\\nThere are situations where there is a prescription drug you are taking, or one that you and your \\nprovider think you should be taking, that is not on our drug list (formulary) or is on our formulary \\nwith restrictions. For example:\\n· The drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug is covered but \\nthe brand name version you want to take is not covered.\\n· The drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for that drug, as \\nexplained in Section 4.\\n· There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you’d like it to be \\ncovered. If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, go to Section 5.2 to \\nlearn what you can do. \\nSection 5.2 \\nWhat can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug is \\nrestricted in some way?\\nIf your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are options:\\n· You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug.\\n· You can change to another drug.\\n· You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions from \\nthe drug.\\nYou may be able to get a temporary supply\\nUnder certain circumstances, the plan must provide a temporary supply of a drug that you are \\nalready taking. This temporary supply gives you time to talk with your provider about the change in \\ncoverage and decide what to do.\\nTo be eligible for a temporary supply, the drug you have been taking must no longer be on the \\nplan’s Drug List OR is now restricted in some way.\\n· If you are a new member, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 days \\nof your membership in the plan.\\n· If you were in the plan last year, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first \\n90 days of the calendar year.\\n· This temporary supply will be for at least a 30-day supply. If your prescription is written for \\nfewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to at least a 30 -day supply of medication. \\nThe prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the long-term care \\npharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.)\\n· For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days and reside in a long-\\nterm care facility and need a supply right away: \\nWe will cover at least a 31-day emergency supply of a particular drug, or less if your \\nprescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary supply.\\n· For those current members with level of care changes:\\nThere may be unplanned transitions such as hospital discharges (including psychiatric \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n121\\nhospitals) or level of care changes (i.e., changing long-term care facilities, exiting and entering \\na long-term care facility, ending Part A coverage within a skilled nursing facility, or ending \\nhospice coverage and reverting to Medicare coverage) that can occur anytime. If you are \\nprescribed a drug that is not on our Drug List or your ability to get your drugs is restricted in \\nsome way, you are required to use the plan’s exception process. For most drugs, you may \\nrequest a one-time temporary supply of at least 30 days to allow you time to discuss alternative \\ntreatment with your doctor or to request a Drug List (formulary) exception. If your doctor writes \\nyour prescription for fewer days, you may refill the drug until you’ve received at least a 30 day \\nsupply.\\nFor questions about a temporary supply, call Customer Service.\\nDuring the time when you are using a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your \\nprovider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You have two options:\\n1) You can change to another drug\\nTalk with your provider about whether there is a different drug covered by the plan that may \\nwork just as well for you. You can call Customer Service to ask for a list of covered drugs that \\ntreat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that \\nmight work for you.\\n2) You can ask for an exception\\nYou and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug in the way \\nyou would like it covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking \\nus for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to. For example, you can \\nask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan’s Drug List. Or you can ask the \\nplan to make an exception and cover the drug without restrictions.\\nIf you are a current member and a drug you are taking will be removed from the formulary or \\nrestricted in some way for next year, we will tell you about any change prior to the new year. You \\ncan ask for an exception before next year and we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we \\nreceive your request (or your prescriber’s supporting statement). If we approve your request, we \\nwill authorize the coverage before the change takes effect.\\nIf you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 7.4 tells you what to do. It \\nexplains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request \\nis handled promptly and fairly.\\nSection 6 \\nWhat if your coverage changes for one of your drugs?\\nSection 6.1 \\nThe Drug List can change during the year\\nMost of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, \\nduring the year, the plan can make some changes to the Drug List. For example, the plan might:\\n· Add or remove drugs from the Drug List.\\n· Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug.\\n· Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n122\\nWe must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan’s Drug List. \\nSection 6.2 \\nWhat happens if coverage changes for a drug you are taking?\\nInformation on changes to drug coverage\\nWhen changes to the Drug List occur, we post information on our website about those changes. \\nWe also update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis. Below we point out the times \\nthat you would get direct notice if changes are made to a drug that you are taking.\\nChanges to your drug coverage that affect you during the current plan year\\n· A new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we change the cost-\\nsharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both) \\n° We may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we are replacing it with a \\nnewly approved generic version of the same drug. The generic drug will appear on the same \\nor lower cost-sharing tier and with the same or fewer restrictions. We may decide to keep the \\nbrand name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to a higher cost-sharing tier or \\nadd new restrictions or both when the new generic is added.\\n° We may not tell you in advance before we make that change—even if you are currently taking \\nthe brand name drug. If you are taking the brand name drug at the time we make the \\nchange, we will provide you with information about the specific change(s). This will also \\ninclude information on the steps you may take to request an exception to cover the brand \\nname drug. You may not get this notice before we make the change.\\n° You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the brand \\nname drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9.\\n· Unsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from the market\\n° Sometimes a drug may be deemed unsafe or taken off the market for another reason. If this \\nhappens, we may immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. If you are taking that \\ndrug, we will tell you right away.\\n° Your prescriber will also know about this change, and can work with you to find another drug \\nfor your condition.\\n· Other changes to drugs on the Drug List\\n° We may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs you are taking. For \\nexample, we might add a generic drug that is not new to the market to replace a brand name \\ndrug on the Drug List or change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand \\nname drug or both. We also might make changes based on FDA boxed warnings or new \\nclinical guidelines recognized by Medicare.\\n° For these changes, we must give you at least 30-days’ advance notice of the change or give \\nyou notice of the change and a 30-day refill of the drug you are taking at a network \\npharmacy.\\n° After you receive notice of the change, you should work with your provider to switch to a \\ndifferent drug that we cover or to satisfy any new restrictions on the drug you are taking.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n123\\n° You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the drug for \\nyou. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9.\\nChanges to the Drug List that do not affect you during this plan year\\nWe may make certain changes to the Drug List that are not described above. In these cases, the \\nchange will not apply to you if you are taking the drug when the change is made; however, these \\nchanges will likely affect you starting January 1 of the next plan year if you stay in the same plan.\\nIn general, changes that will not affect you during the current plan year are:\\n· We put a new restriction on the use of your drug.\\n· We remove your drug from the Drug List.\\nIf any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (except for market withdrawal, a generic \\ndrug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections above), then the change \\nwon’t affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cost until January 1 of the next year. \\nUntil that date, you probably won’t see any increase in your payments or any added restrictions to \\nyour use of the drug. \\nWe will not tell you about these types of changes directly during the current plan year. You will \\nneed to check the Drug List for the next plan year (when the list is available during the open \\nenrollment period) to see if there are any changes to the drugs you are taking that will impact you \\nduring the next plan year.\\nSection 7 \\nWhat types of drugs are not covered by the plan?\\nSection 7.1 \\nTypes of drugs we do not cover\\nThis section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are “excluded.” This means Medicare does \\nnot pay for these drugs.\\nIf you appeal and the requested drug is found not to be excluded under Part D, we will pay for or \\ncover it. (For information about appealing a decision, go to Chapter 9.) If the drug excluded by our \\nplan is also excluded by Medicaid, you must pay for it yourself.\\nHere are four general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover under Part D:\\n· Our plan’s Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare \\nPart A or Part B.\\n· Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States or its territories.\\n· Our plan usually cannot cover off-label use. “Off-label use” is any use of the drug other than \\nthose indicated on a drug’s label as approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\\n· Coverage for “off-label use” is allowed only when the use is supported by certain references, \\nsuch as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX \\nInformation System. \\nIn addition, by law, the following categories of drugs listed below are not covered by Medicare.   \\nHowever, some of these drugs may be covered for you under your Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n124\\ndrug coverage. Please check your Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) Drug list to see if any of the drugs \\nlisted below are covered: \\n· Non-prescription drugs (also called over-the-counter drugs).\\n· Drugs used to promote fertility.\\n· Drugs used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms.\\n· Drugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth.\\n· Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations.\\n· \\n Drugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction.\\n· Drugs used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain.\\n· Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or \\nmonitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer as a condition of sale.\\nSection 8 \\nFilling a prescription\\nSection 8.1 \\nProvide your UnitedHealthcare member ID information\\nTo fill your prescription, provide your UnitedHealthcare member ID information, which can be \\nfound on your member ID card, at the network pharmacy you choose. The network pharmacy will \\nautomatically bill the plan for your drug. You will need to pay the pharmacy your share of the cost \\nwhen you pick up your prescription.\\nSection 8.2 \\nWhat if you don’t have your UnitedHealthcare member ID information \\nwith you?\\nIf you don’t have your UnitedHealthcare member ID information with you when you fill your \\nprescription, you or the pharmacy can call the plan to get the necessary information.\\nIf the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost of \\nthe prescription when you pick it up. (You can then ask us to reimburse you for our share. See \\nChapter 7, Section 2.1 for information about how to ask the plan for reimbursement.)\\nSection 9 \\nPart D drug coverage in special situations\\nSection 9.1 \\nWhat if you’re in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility for a stay that is \\ncovered by the plan?\\nIf you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we will \\ngenerally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay. Once you leave the hospital or \\nskilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your prescription drugs as long as the drugs meet all of \\nour rules for coverage described in this Chapter. \\nSection 9.2 \\nWhat if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility?\\nUsually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy, or uses a \\npharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of a LTC facility, you may \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n125\\nget your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy or the one it uses, as long as it is part of \\nour network.\\nCheck your Pharmacy Directory to find out if your LTC facility’s pharmacy or the one that it uses is \\npart of our network. If it isn’t, or if you need more information or assistance, please contact \\nCustomer Service. If you are in an LTC facility, we must ensure that you are able to routinely receive \\nyour Part D benefits through our network of LTC pharmacies.\\nWhat if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a drug that is not on our \\nDrug List or is restricted in some way?\\nPlease refer to Section 5.2 about a temporary or emergency supply.\\nSection 9.3 \\nWhat if you’re also getting drug coverage from an employer or  retiree \\ngroup plan?\\nIf you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s) employer \\nor retiree group please contact that group’s benefits administrator. He or she can help you \\ndetermine how your current prescription drug coverage will work with our plan.\\nIn general, if you have employee or retiree group coverage, the drug coverage you get from us will \\nbe secondary to your group coverage. That means your group coverage would pay first. \\nSpecial note about ‘creditable coverage’:\\nEach year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your prescription \\ndrug coverage for the next calendar year is “creditable.” \\nIf the coverage from the group plan is “creditable,” it means that the plan has drug coverage that is \\nexpected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.\\nKeep this notice about creditable coverage, because you may need it later. If you enroll in a \\nMedicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need this notice to show that you have \\nmaintained creditable coverage. If you didn’t get the creditable coverage notice, request a copy \\nfrom the employer or retiree group\\'s benefits administrator or the employer or union.\\nSection 9.4 \\nWhat if you’re in Medicare-certified hospice?\\nDrugs related to your terminal prognosis will be covered under our hospice benefit as described \\nunder Hospice Care and Related Services in the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4.\\nDrugs unrelated to your terminal prognosis will be covered under our Medicare Part B drugs as \\ndescribed in the Medical Benefits Chart or under Medicare Part D. For more information about your \\nPart D coverage and what you must pay, see Chapter 6.\\nYour hospice provider must let us know if the drug is related or unrelated to your terminal \\nprognosis so we can determine which benefit and cost-sharing applies to the drug.\\nIf you revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice, our plan should cover all your \\ndrugs. To prevent any delays at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, you should \\nbring documentation to the pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n126\\nSection 10 \\nPrograms on drug safety and managing medications\\nSection 10.1 \\nPrograms to help members use drugs safely\\nWe conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting safe and \\nappropriate care. \\nWe do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. \\nDuring these reviews, we look for potential problems such as: \\n· Possible medication errors\\n· Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same \\ncondition\\n· Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender\\n· Certain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time\\n· Prescriptions for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to\\n· Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking\\n· Unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications\\nIf we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider to correct \\nthe problem. \\nSection 10.2 \\nDrug Management Program (DMP) to help members safely use their \\nopioid medications\\nWe have a program that helps make sure members safely use prescription opioids and other \\nfrequently abused medications. This program is called a Drug Management Program (DMP). If you \\nuse opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent \\nopioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use of opioid medications is \\nappropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of \\nprescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get those \\nmedications. If we place you in our DMP, the limitations may be:\\n· Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a \\ncertain pharmacy(ies)\\n· Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a \\ncertain doctor(s)\\n· Limiting the amount of opioid or benzodiazepine medications we will cover for you\\nIf we plan on limiting how you may get these medications or how much you can get, we will send \\nyou a letter in advance. The letter will explain the limitations we think should apply to you. You will \\nhave an opportunity to tell us which doctors or pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any other \\ninformation you think is important for us to know. After you’ve had the opportunity to respond, if we \\ndecide to limit your coverage for these medications, we will send you another letter confirming the \\nlimitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our determination or with the \\nlimitation, you and your prescriber have the right to appeal. If you appeal, we will review your case \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n127\\nand give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of your request related to the limitations \\nthat apply to your access to medications, we will automatically send your case to an independent \\nreviewer outside of our plan. See Chapter 9 for information about how to ask for an appeal.\\nYou will not be placed in our DMP if you have certain medical conditions, such as active cancer-\\nrelated pain or sickle cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative, or end-of-life care, or live in \\na long-term care facility.\\nSection 10.3 \\nMedication Therapy Management (MTM) programs to help members \\nmanage their medications\\nWe have programs that can help our members with complex health needs. One program is called a \\nMedication Therapy Management (MTM) program. These programs are voluntary and free. A team \\nof pharmacists and doctors developed the programs for us to help make sure that our members \\nget the most benefit from the drugs they take.\\nSome members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high drug costs, \\nor are in a DMP to help members use their opioids safely, may be able to get services through an \\nMTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of \\nall your medications. During the review, you can talk about your medications, your costs, and any \\nproblems or questions you have about your prescription and over-the-counter medications. You’ll \\nget a written summary which has a recommended to-do list that includes steps you should take to \\nget the best results from your medications. You’ll also get a medication list that will include all the \\nmedications you’re taking, how much you take, and when and why you take them. In addition, \\nmembers in the MTM program will receive information on the safe disposal of prescription \\nmedications that are controlled substances. \\nIt’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about your recommended to-do list and medication list. Bring \\nthe summary with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your doctors, pharmacists, and other \\nhealth care providers. Also, keep your medication list up to date and keep it with you (for example, \\nwith your ID) in case you go to the hospital or emergency room.\\nIf we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send \\nyou information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us and we will withdraw you. If you \\nhave any questions about these programs, please contact Customer Service.\\nSection 11 \\nWe send you reports that explain payments for your drugs \\nand which payment stage you are in\\nSection 11.1 \\nWe send you a monthly report called the “Part D Explanation of \\nBenefits” (the “Part D EOB”)\\nOur plan keeps track of the costs of your prescription drugs and the payments you have made \\nwhen you get your prescriptions filled or refilled at the pharmacy. This way, we can tell you when \\nyou have moved from one drug payment stage to the next. In particular, there are two types of \\ncosts we keep track of:\\n· We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your “out-of-pocket” cost.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n128\\n· We keep track of your “total drug costs.” This is the amount you pay out-of-pocket or others \\npay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan.\\nOur plan will prepare a written report called the Part D Explanation of Benefits (it is sometimes \\ncalled the “Part D EOB”) when you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan \\nduring the previous month. The Part D EOB provides more information about the drugs you take, \\nsuch as increases in price and other drugs with lower cost-sharing that may be available. You \\nshould consult with your prescriber about these lower cost options. It includes:\\n· Information for that month. This report gives the payment details about the prescriptions you \\nhave filled during the previous month. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, and \\nwhat you and others on your behalf paid.\\n· Totals for the year since January 1. This is called “year-to-date” information. It shows you the \\ntotal drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year began.\\n· Drug price information. This information will display cumulative percentage increases for each \\nprescription claim.\\n· Available lower cost alternative prescriptions. This will include information about other drugs \\nwith lower cost-sharing for each prescription claim that may be available.\\nSection 11.2 \\nHelp us keep our information about your drug payments up to date\\nTo keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records we get \\nfrom pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct and up to date:\\n· Show your UnitedHealthcare member ID card when you get a prescription filled. To make sure \\nwe know about the prescriptions you are filling and what you are paying, show your \\nUnitedHealthcare  member ID card every time you get a prescription filled.\\n· Make sure we have the information we need. There are times you may pay for prescription \\ndrugs when we will not automatically get the information we need to keep track of your out-of-\\npocket costs. To help us keep track of your out-of-pocket costs, you may give us copies of \\nreceipts for drugs that you have purchased. (If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask \\nour plan to pay our share of the cost for the drug. For instructions on how to do this, go to \\nChapter 7, Section 2 of this booklet.) Here are some types of situations when you may want to \\ngive us copies of your drug receipts to be sure we have a complete record of what you have \\nspent for your drugs:\\no When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a \\ndiscount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit.\\no When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer patient \\nassistance program.\\no Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out-of-network pharmacies or other times \\nyou have paid the full price for a covered drug under special circumstances.\\n· Send us information about the payments others have made for you. Payments made by certain \\nother individuals and organizations also count toward your out-of-pocket costs and help qualify \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 5: Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n129\\nyou for catastrophic coverage. For example, payments made by an AIDS drug assistance \\nprogram (ADAP), the Indian Health Service, and most charities count toward your out-of-pocket \\ncosts. You should keep a record of these payments and send them to us so we can track your \\ncosts.\\n· Check the written report we send you. When you receive a Part D Explanation of Benefits (a \\nPart D EOB) in the mail, please look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. \\nIf you think something is missing from the report, or you have any questions, please call us at \\nCustomer Service (phone numbers are printed on the cover of this booklet). Be sure to keep these \\nreports. They are an important record of your drug expenses.\\n\\n\\nChapter 6\\nChapter 6: What you pay for \\nyour Part D prescription drugs\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 6: What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n131\\n  \\nWhat you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\nBecause you are eligible for Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid), you qualify for and are \\ngetting “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drug plan costs. As a \\nmember of UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP) getting “Extra \\nHelp” from Medicare, you don’t pay anything for covered Part D drugs.

If you get a bill \\nfor the full cost of medical care or drugs you have received, you should send this bill to us so that \\nwe can pay it. When you send us the bill, we will look at the bill and decide whether the services \\nshould be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. \\nIf you have already paid for a Medicare service or item covered by the plan, you can ask our \\nplan to pay you back (paying you back is often called “reimbursing” you). It is your right to be paid \\nback by our plan whenever you’ve paid more than your share of the cost for medical services or \\ndrugs that are covered by our plan. There may be deadlines that you must meet to get paid back. \\nPlease see Section 2 of this chapter. When you send us a bill you have already paid, we will look at \\nthe bill and decide whether the services or drugs should be covered. If we decide they should be \\ncovered, we will pay you back for the services or drugs.\\nThere may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you \\nhave received or possibly for more than your share of cost sharing as discussed in the document. \\nFirst try to resolve the bill with the provider. If that does not work, send the bill to us instead of \\npaying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide \\nthey should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. If we decide not to pay it, we will notify the \\nprovider. You should never pay more than plan-allowed cost-sharing. If this provider is contracted \\nyou still have the right to treatment.\\nHere are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a \\nbill you have received:\\n1. When you’ve received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is \\nnot in our plan’s network\\nYou can receive emergency or urgently needed services from any provider in the United States, \\nwhether or not the provider is a part of our network. In these cases, ask the provider to bill the \\nplan.\\n· If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, ask us to pay you back \\nfor our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you \\nhave made.\\n· You may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send \\nus this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made.\\n° If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. \\n° If you have already paid more than your share of the cost for the service, we will determine \\nhow much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost.\\n2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay\\nNetwork providers should always bill the plan directly. But sometimes they make mistakes and \\nask you to pay more than your share of the cost.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical \\nservices or drugs\\n134\\n· If you are eligible for Medicare cost-sharing assistance under Medicaid, we do not allow \\nproviders to bill you for covered services. We pay our providers directly, and we protect you \\nfrom any charges. This is true even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a \\nservice.\\n· Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, \\nsend us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. \\n· If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, \\nsend us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made. You should ask \\nus to pay you back for the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you \\nowed under the plan.\\n3. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan \\nSometimes a person’s enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (This means that the first day of their \\nenrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.)\\nIf you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out-of-pocket for any of your covered \\nservices or drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncosts. You will need to submit paperwork such as receipts and bills for us to handle the \\nreimbursement. \\n4. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled\\nIf you go to an out-of-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim \\ndirectly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. \\nSave your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncost. Remember that we only cover out-of-network pharmacies in limited circumstances. See \\nChapter 5, Section 2.5 for a discussion of these circumstances.\\n5. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don’t have your UnitedHealthcare \\nmember ID card with you\\nIf you do not have your UnitedHealthcare member ID card with you, you can ask the pharmacy \\nto call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy cannot \\nget the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the \\nprescription yourself.\\nSave your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncost.\\n6. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations \\nYou may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for \\nsome reason. \\n· For example, the drug may not be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary); or it \\ncould have a requirement or restriction that you didn’t know about or don’t think should \\napply to you. If you decide to get the drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for \\nit. \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 7: Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical \\nservices or drugs\\n135\\n· Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some \\nsituations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in order to pay you back \\nfor our share of the cost of the drug.\\n7. When you utilize your Worldwide Emergency Coverage, Worldwide Urgently Needed \\nServices, or Worldwide Emergency Transportation benefits \\nYou will pay the full cost of emergency services received outside of the United States at the time \\nyou receive services. To receive reimbursement from us, you must do the following: \\n· Pay your bill at the time it is received. We will reimburse you for the difference between the \\namount of your bill and your cost share for the services as outlined in Chapter 4 of this \\ndocument. \\n· Save all of your receipts and send us copies when you ask us to pay you back. In some \\nsituations, we may need to get more information from you or the provider who rendered \\nservices to you in order to pay you back for our share of the cost. Please see Chapter 7 \\nSection 2.1 for expense reimbursement for worldwide services. \\n· If you are being asked to pay your bill for worldwide emergency services and are unable to \\nmake the payment, please call Customer Service for additional assistance and we may be \\nable to help coordinate payment for covered services on your behalf.\\nWhen you send us a request for payment, we will review your request and decide whether the \\nservice or drug should be covered. This is called making a “coverage decision.” If we decide it \\nshould be covered, we will pay for our share of the cost for the service or drug. If we deny your \\nrequest for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 9 of this document has information \\nabout how to make an appeal.\\nSection 2 \\nHow to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have \\nreceived\\nYou may request us to pay you back by sending us a request in writing.

The process you use to \\nhandle your problem depends on two things:\\n1. Whether your problem is about benefits covered by Medicare or Medicaid. If you would like \\nhelp deciding whether to use the Medicare process or the Medicaid process, or both, please \\ncontact Customer Service.\\n2. The type of problem you are having:\\n° For some problems, you need to use the process for coverage decisions and appeals. \\n° For other problems, you need to use the process for making complaints; also called \\ngrievances.\\nThese processes have been approved by Medicare. Each process has a set of rules, procedures, \\nand deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.\\nThe guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you should do.\\nSection 1.2 \\nWhat about the legal terms?\\nThere are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this \\nchapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To \\nmake things easier, this chapter:\\n· Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says \\n“making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage decision” rather than \\n“organization determination” or “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination” and \\n“independent review organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.”\\n· It also uses abbreviations as little as possible.\\nHowever, it can be helpful – and sometimes quite important – for you to know the correct legal \\nterms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more accurately to get the right help \\nor information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms \\nwhen we give the details for handling specific types of situations.\\nSection 2 \\nWhere to get more information and personalized assistance\\nWe are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment of you, we \\nare obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always reach out to customer \\nservice for help. But in some situations, you may also want help or guidance from someone who is \\nnot connected with us. Below are two entities that can assist you.\\nState Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)\\nEach state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not connected with \\nus or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at this program can help you \\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n153\\nunderstand which process you should use to handle a problem you are having. They can also \\nanswer your questions, give you more information, and offer guidance on what to do.\\nThe services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone numbers in Chapter 2, Section 3 of \\nthis document.\\nMedicare\\nYou can also contact Medicare to get help. To contact Medicare:\\n· You can call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users \\nshould call 1-877-486-2048.\\n· You can also visit the Medicare website (www.medicare.gov). \\nYou can get help and information from Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid)\\nFor more information and help in handling a problem, you can also contact Alabama Medicaid \\n(Medicaid). Here are two ways to get information directly from Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid):\\n· You can call 1-800-362-1504. TTY users should call 1-800-253-0799.\\n· You can visit the Alabama Medicaid (Medicaid) website (http://www.medicaid.alabama.gov/).\\nSection 3 \\nTo deal with your problem, which process should you use?\\nBecause you have Medicare and get assistance from Medicaid, you have different processes that \\nyou can use to handle your problem or complaint. Which process you use depends on whether the \\nproblem is about Medicare benefits or Medicaid benefits. If your problem is about a benefit \\ncovered by Medicare, then you should use the Medicare process. If your problem is about a benefit \\ncovered by Medicaid, then you should use the Medicaid process. If you would like help deciding \\nwhether to use the Medicare process or the Medicaid process, please contact Customer Service.\\nThe Medicare process and Medicaid process are described in different parts of this chapter. To \\nfind out which part you should read, use the chart below.\\nIs your problem about Medicare benefits or Medicaid benefits?\\nIf you would like help deciding whether your problem is about Medicare benefits or Medicaid \\nbenefits, please contact Customer Service.\\nMy problem is about Medicare benefits.\\nGo to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, “Handling problems about your \\nMedicare benefits.”\\nMy problem is about Medicaid coverage.\\nSkip ahead to Section 12 of this chapter, “Handling problems about your Medicaid \\nbenefits.”\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n154\\nProblems about your Medicare benefits\\nSection 4 \\nHandling problems about your Medicare benefits \\nSection 4.1 \\nShould you use the process for coverage decisions and appeals?

This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or \\nnot and the way in which something is covered.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n155\\nAsking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services\\nA coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount \\nwe will pay for your medical services or drugs. We are making a coverage decision whenever we \\ndecide what is covered for you and how much we pay. For example, your plan network doctor \\nmakes a (favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her \\nor if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us \\nand ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical \\nservice or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to \\nknow if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage \\ndecision for you. In limited circumstances a request for a coverage decision will be dismissed, \\nwhich means we won’t review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if \\nthe request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn’t legally authorized \\nto do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a coverage \\ndecision, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a \\nreview of the dismissal.\\nIn some cases, we might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer covered by \\nMedicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal.\\nMaking an appeal\\nIf we make a coverage decision and you are not satisfied, you can “appeal” the decision. An appeal \\nis a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made.\\nUnder certain circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or “fast \\nappeal” of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who \\nmade the original decision. When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 \\nappeal. In this appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were \\nproperly following the rules.\\nWhen we have completed the review, we give you our decision. In limited circumstances a request \\nfor a Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means we won’t review the request. Examples of \\nwhen a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the \\nrequest on your behalf but isn’t legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be \\nwithdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a Level 1 appeal, we will send a notice explaining why the \\nrequest was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal.\\nIf we say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, your appeal will automatically go on to Level 2. The \\nLevel 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review organization that is not connected to us.\\n· You do not need to do anything to start a Level 2 appeal. Medicare rules require we \\nautomatically send your appeal to Level 2 if we do not fully agree with your Level 1 appeal.\\n· See Section 6.4 of this chapter for more information about Level 2 appeals.\\nIf you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through \\nadditional levels of appeal (Section 10 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals \\nprocesses).\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n156\\nSection 5.2 \\nHow to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or \\nmaking an appeal\\nHere are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision:\\n· You can call us at Customer Service.\\n· You can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\\n· Your doctor can make a request for you. If your doctor helps with an appeal past Level 2, \\nthey will need to be appointed as your representative. Please call Customer Service and ask for \\nthe “Appointment of Representative” form. (The form is also available on Medicare’s website at\\nwww.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMSForms/downloads/cms1696.pdf.)\\n° For medical care, your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 appeal on your \\nbehalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2. \\n° For Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage \\ndecision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your Level 1 appeal is denied your doctor or \\nprescriber can request a Level 2 appeal.\\n· You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person to \\nact for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal.\\n° If you want a friend, relative, or another person to be your representative, call Customer \\nService and ask for the “Appointment of Representative” form. (The form is also available on \\nMedicare’s website at\\nwww.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf .) The form \\ngives that person permission to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the \\nperson who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form.\\n° While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot begin or complete our \\nreview until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 calendar days after receiving \\nyour appeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal \\nrequest will be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining your \\nright to ask the independent review organization to review our decision to dismiss your \\nappeal.\\n· You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer, or get the name of \\na lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. There are also groups that will \\ngive you free legal services if you qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to \\nask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision.\\nSection 5.3 \\nWhich section of this chapter gives the details for your situation?\\nThere are four different situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each \\nsituation has different rules and deadlines, we give the details for each one in a separate section:\\n· Section 6 of this chapter: “Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an \\nappeal”\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n157\\n· Section 7 of this chapter: “Your Part D prescription drugs: How to ask for a coverage decision \\nor make an appeal of a coverage decision”\\n· Section 8 of this chapter: “How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think \\nthe doctor is discharging you too soon”\\n· Section 9 of this chapter: “How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think \\nyour coverage is ending too soon” (Applies only to these services: home health care, skilled \\nnursing facility care, hospice care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility \\n(CORF) services)\\nIf you’re not sure which section you should be using, please call Customer Service. You can also \\nget help or information from government organizations such as your State Health Insurance \\nAssistance Program.\\nSection 6 \\nYour medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or \\nmake an appeal of a coverage decision\\nSection 6.1 \\nThis section tells what to do if you have problems getting coverage for \\nmedical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost \\nof your care\\nThis section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in \\nChapter 4 of this document: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay). To \\nkeep things simple, we generally refer to “medical care coverage” or “medical care” which \\nincludes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, \\ndifferent rules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how \\nthe rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services.\\nThis section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations:\\n1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered \\nby our plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 6.2.\\n2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to \\ngive you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan. Ask for a coverage decision. \\nSection 6.2.\\n3. You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we \\nhave said we will not pay for this care. Make an appeal. Section 6.3.\\n4. You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the \\nplan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section \\n6.5.\\n5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we \\npreviously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping \\nthis care could harm your health. Make an appeal. Section 6.3.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n158\\nNote: If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled \\nnursing facility care, hospice care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility \\n(CORF) services, you need to read Sections 8 and 9 of this Chapter. Special rules apply to these \\ntypes of care.\\nSection 6.2 \\nStep-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision\\nLegal Terms:\\nWhen a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \\n“organization determination.”\\nA “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited determination.”\\n   \\nStep 1: Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage \\ndecision”.\\nA “standard coverage decision” is usually made within 14 days or 72 hours for Part B drugs. A \\n“fast coverage decision” is generally made within 72 hours, for medical services, or 24 hours \\nfor Part B drugs. In order to get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements:\\n· You may only ask for coverage for medical care you have not yet received.\\n· You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious \\nharm to your health or hurt your ability to function.\\n· If your doctor tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage decision,” we will \\nautomatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. \\n· If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor’s support, we will \\ndecide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not \\napprove a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that:\\n° Explains that we will use the standard deadlines.\\n° Explains if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give you a \\nfast coverage decision. \\n° Explains that you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give you a standard \\ncoverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested.\\n  \\nStep 2: Ask our plan to make a coverage decision or fast coverage decision.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n159\\nStart by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide \\ncoverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. \\nChapter 2 has contact information.\\n  \\nStep 3: We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our \\nanswer.\\nFor standard coverage decisions we use the standard deadlines.\\nThis means we will give you an answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your request for \\na medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will give \\nyou an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request.\\n· However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you we can \\ntake up to 14 more days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, \\nwe will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a \\nMedicare Part B prescription drug.\\n· If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint”. We will give you an \\nanswer to your complaint as soon as we make the decision. (The process for making a \\ncomplaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. See Section 11 of \\nthis chapter for information on complaints.)\\nFor Fast Coverage decisions we use an expedited timeframe\\nA fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours if your request is for a medical \\nitem or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer \\nwithin 24 hours.\\n· However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you we can \\ntake up to 14 more days. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra \\ntime to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.\\n· If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint.” (See Section 11 of \\nthis chapter for information on complaints.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision.\\n· If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written statement \\nthat explains why we said no.\\n \\nStep 4: If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you can appeal.\\n· If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making an appeal. This \\nmeans asking again to get the medical care coverage you want. If you make an appeal, it \\nmeans you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process.\\nSection 6.3 \\nStep-by-step: How to make a Level 1 appeal\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n160\\nLegal Terms:\\nAn appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a \\nplan “reconsideration.”\\nA “fast appeal” is also called an “expedited reconsideration.”\\n  \\nStep 1: Decide if you need a “standard appeal” or a “fast appeal.”\\nA “standard appeal” is usually made within 30 days. A “fast appeal” is generally made within \\n72 hours.\\n· If you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care that you have not yet \\nreceived, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a “fast appeal.” If your doctor \\ntells us that your health requires a “fast appeal,” we will give you a fast appeal.\\n· The requirements for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting a “fast coverage \\ndecision” in Section 6.2 of this chapter.\\n  \\nStep 2: Ask our plan for an Appeal or a Fast Appeal\\n· If you are asking for a standard appeal, submit your standard appeal in writing. Chapter 2 \\nhas contact information.\\n· If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us. Chapter 2 has \\ncontact information.\\n· You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written \\nnotice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and \\nhave a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your \\nappeal. We may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may \\ninclude a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with \\nincorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal.\\n· You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision. You and your \\ndoctor may add more information to support your appeal.\\n  \\nStep 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer.\\n· When we are reviewing your appeal, we take a careful look at all of the information. We check \\nto see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n161\\n· We will gather more information if needed, possibly contacting you or your doctor.\\nDeadlines for a “fast appeal”\\n· For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. \\nWe will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to. \\n° However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we \\ncan take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we \\ntake extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time if your request is for a \\nMedicare Part B prescription drug.\\n° If we do not give you an answer within 72 hours (or by the end of the extended time period if \\nwe took extra days), we are required to automatically send your request on to Level 2 of the \\nappeals process, where it will be reviewed by an independent review organization. Section \\n6.4 explains the Level 2 appeal process.\\n· If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the \\ncoverage we have agreed to provide within 72 hours after we receive your appeal. \\n· If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you our decision in \\nwriting and automatically forward your appeal to the independent review organization for a \\nLevel 2 appeal. The independent review organization will notify you in writing when it receives \\nyour appeal.\\nDeadlines for a “standard appeal”\\n· For standard appeals, we must give you our answer within 30 calendar days after we receive \\nyour appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug you have not yet \\nreceived, we will give you our answer within 7 calendar days after we receive your appeal. We \\nwill give you our decision sooner if your health condition requires us to. \\n° However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we \\ncan take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we \\ntake extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time to make a decision if your \\nrequest is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.\\n° If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint”.

It is \\nnot connected with us and is not a government agency. This organization decides whether the \\ndecision we made is correct or if it should be changed. Medicare oversees its work.\\n  \\nStep 1: The independent review organization reviews your appeal.\\n· We will send the information about your appeal to this organization. This information is called \\nyour “case file.” You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file. \\n· You have a right to give the independent review organization additional information to support \\nyour appeal.\\n· Reviewers at the independent review organization will take a careful look at all of the \\ninformation related to your appeal.\\nIf you had a “fast” appeal at Level 1, you will also have a “fast” appeal at Level 2 \\n· For the “fast appeal” the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal \\nwithin 72 hours of when it receives your appeal.\\n· However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the independent review \\norganization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more \\ncalendar days. The independent review organization can’t take extra time to make a decision if \\nyour request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.\\nIf you had a “standard” appeal at Level 1, you will also have a “standard” appeal at Level 2\\n· For a “standard appeal” if your request is for a medical item or service, the review organization \\nmust give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal within 30 calendar days of when it receives \\nyour appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, the review organization \\nmust give you an answer to your Level 2 appeal within 7 calendar days of when it receives your \\nappeal.\\n· However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the independent review \\norganization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, it can take up to 14 more \\ncalendar days.

(This is \\ncalled “upholding the decision” or “turning down your appeal.”) In this case, the independent \\nreview organization will send you a letter:\\n° Explaining its decision.\\n° Notifying you of the right to a Level 3 appeal if the dollar value of the medical care coverage \\nmeets a certain minimum. The written notice you get from the independent review \\norganization will tell you the dollar amount you must meet to continue the appeals process.\\n° Telling you how to file a Level 3 appeal.\\n     \\nStep 3: If your case meets the requirements, you choose whether you want to take \\nyour appeal further.\\n· There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of \\nappeal). If you want to go to a Level 3 appeal the details on how to do this are in the written \\nnotice you get after your Level 2 appeal.\\n· The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator.

If you make an \\nappeal, it means you are asking us to change the coverage decision we made when we turned \\ndown your request for payment.\\nTo make this appeal, follow the process for appeals that we describe in Section 6.3. For \\nappeals concerning reimbursement, please note:\\n· We must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal.

To be covered, the drug must be used \\nfor a medically accepted indication. (See Chapter 5 for more information about a medically \\naccepted indication.) For details about Part D drugs, rules, restrictions, and costs please see \\nChapters 5 and 6. This section is about your Part D drugs only. To keep things simple, we \\ngenerally say “drug” in the rest of this section, instead of repeating “covered outpatient \\nprescription drug” or “Part D drug” every time. We also use the term “drug list” instead of “List of \\nCovered Drugs” or “Formulary.”\\n· If you do not know if a drug is covered or if you meet the rules, you can ask us. Some drugs \\nrequire that you get approval from us before we will cover it.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n165\\n· If your pharmacy tells you that your prescription cannot be filled as written, the pharmacy will \\ngive you a written notice explaining how to contact us to ask for a coverage decision.\\nPart D coverage decisions and appeals \\nLegal Term An initial coverage decision about your Part D drugs is called a \\n“coverage determination.”\\nA coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount \\nwe will pay for your drugs. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the following \\nsituations:\\n· Asking to cover a Part D drug that is not on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs. Ask for an \\nexception. Section 7.2\\n· Asking to waive a restriction on the plan’s coverage for a drug (such as limits on the amount of \\nthe drug you can get). Ask for an exception. Section 7.2\\n· Asking to get pre-approval for a drug. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 7.4\\n· Pay for a prescription drug you already bought. Ask us to pay you back. Section 7.4\\nIf you disagree with a coverage decision we have made, you can appeal our decision. \\nThis section tells you both how to ask for coverage decisions and how to request an appeal.\\nSection 7.2 \\nWhat is an exception?\\nLegal Terms:\\nAsking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is sometimes \\ncalled asking for a “formulary exception.”\\nAsking for removal of a restriction on coverage for a drug is sometimes \\ncalled asking for a “formulary exception.”\\nAsking to pay a lower price for a covered non-preferred drug is sometimes \\ncalled asking for a “tiering exception.”\\nIf a drug is not covered in the way you would like it to be covered, you can ask us to make an \\n“exception.” An exception is a type of coverage decision.\\nFor us to consider your exception request, your doctor or other prescriber will need to explain the \\nmedical reasons why you need the exception approved. Here are two examples of exceptions that \\nyou or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to make:\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n166\\n1. Covering a Part D drug for you that is not on our Drug List. If we agree to cover a drug not \\non the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount that applies to all of our drugs. \\nYou cannot ask for an exception to the cost-sharing amount we require you to pay for the drug. \\n2. Removing a restriction for a covered drug. Chapter 5 describes the extra rules or restrictions \\nthat apply to certain drugs on our Drug List. \\nSection 7.3 \\nImportant things to know about asking for exceptions\\nYour doctor must tell us the medical reasons\\nYour doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical reasons for \\nrequesting an exception. For a faster decision, include this medical information from your doctor or \\nother prescriber when you ask for the exception.\\nTypically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition. These \\ndifferent possibilities are called “alternative” drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as effective \\nas the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side effects or other health problems, we \\nwill generally not approve your request for an exception. \\nWe can say yes or no to your request\\n· If we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid until the end of the \\nplan year. This is true as long as your doctor continues to prescribe the drug for you and that \\ndrug continues to be safe and effective for treating your condition.\\n· If we say no to your request, you can ask for another review by making an appeal.\\nSection 7.4 \\nStep-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an \\nexception\\nLegal Term\\nA “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited coverage \\ndetermination.”\\n  \\nStep 1: Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage \\ndecision.”\\n“Standard coverage decisions” are made within 72 hours after we receive your doctor’s \\nstatement. “Fast coverage decisions” are made within 24 hours after we receive your doctor’s \\nstatement.\\nIf your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision.” To get a fast coverage \\ndecision, you must meet two requirements:\\n· You must be asking for a drug you have not yet received. (You cannot ask for fast coverage \\ndecision to be paid back for a drug you have already bought.)\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n167\\n· Using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to \\nfunction.\\n· If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage \\ndecision,” we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision. \\n· If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor or prescriber’s \\nsupport, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. \\nIf we do not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that:\\n° Explains that we will use the standard deadlines.\\n° Explains if your doctor or other prescriber asks for the fast coverage decision, we will \\nautomatically give you a fast coverage decision.\\n° Tells you how you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give you a standard \\ncoverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. We will answer your \\ncomplaint within 24 hours of receipt.\\n  \\nStep 2: Request a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage decision.”\\nStart by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide \\ncoverage for the medical care you want. You can also access the coverage decision process \\nthrough our website. We must accept any written request, including a request submitted on the \\nCMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form, which is available on our website. Chapter 2 \\nhas contact information. To assist us in processing your request, please be sure to include your \\nname, contact information, and information identifying which denied claim is being appealed.\\nYou, your doctor, (or other prescriber) or your representative can do this. You can also have a \\nlawyer act on your behalf. Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give written permission to \\nsomeone else to act as your representative.\\n· If you are requesting an exception, provide the “supporting statement,” which is the medical \\nreasons for the exception. Your doctor or other prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. \\nOr your doctor or other prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by faxing or mailing a \\nwritten statement if necessary.\\n  \\nStep 3: We consider your request and give you our answer.\\nDeadlines for a “fast” coverage decision\\n· We must generally give you our answer within 24 hours after we receive your request.\\n° For exceptions, we will give you our answer within 24 hours after we receive your doctor’s \\nsupporting statement.

If you put your complaint in writing, we will respond to your \\ncomplaint in writing. \\n· We must receive your complaint within 60 calendar days of the event or incident you are \\ncomplaining about.

We will address your complaint as quickly as possible but no later than \\n30 days after receiving it.\\xa0Sometimes we need additional information, or you may wish to \\nprovide additional information. If that occurs, we may take an additional 14 days to respond to \\nyour complaint. If the additional 14 days is taken, you will receive a letter letting you know. \\nIf your complaint is because we took 14 extra days to respond to your request for a coverage \\ndetermination or appeal or because we decided you didn’t need a fast coverage decision or a \\nfast appeal, you can file a fast complaint.

If we decide to take extra \\ndays, we will tell you in writing.\\n· If you are making a complaint because we denied your request for a “fast coverage \\ndecision” or a “fast appeal,” we will automatically give you a “fast complaint”. If you have a \\n“fast complaint,” it means we will give you an answer within 24 hours. \\n· If we do not agree with some or all of your complaint or don’t take responsibility for the \\nproblem you are complaining about, we will include our reasons in our response to you.\\n\\n\\n2023 Evidence of Coverage for UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® (HMO-POS D-SNP)\\nChapter 9: What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n191\\nSection 11.4 \\nYou can also make complaints about quality of care to the Quality \\nImprovement Organization\\nWhen your complaint is about quality of care, you also have two extra options: \\n· You can make your complaint directly to the Quality Improvement Organization.\\n· The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of practicing doctors and other health care \\nexperts paid by the Federal government to check and improve the care given to Medicare \\npatients.

A benefit period begins the day you go into a hospital or skilled nursing \\nfacility. The benefit period ends when you have not received any inpatient hospital care (or skilled \\ncare in a SNF) for 60 days in a row.
