We are required to cover all Part A and Part B \\nservices. However, cost sharing and provider access in this plan differ from Original \\nMedicare.\\nThere are different types of Medicare health plans. Devoted PRIME (HMO) is a Medicare \\nAdvantage HMO Plan (HMO stands for Health Maintenance Organization) approved by \\nMedicare and run by a private company. \\xa0\\nCoverage under this Plan qualifies as Qualifying Health Coverage (QHC) and satisfies the \\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) individual shared responsibility requirement. \\nPlease visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website at: www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/  \\nIndividuals-and-Families  for more information. \\xa0\\nSection 1.2 What is the Evidence of Coverage  document about?\\nThis Evidence of Coverage  document tells you how to get your medical care and prescription \\ndrugs. It explains your rights and responsibilities, what is covered, what you pay as a member of \\nthe plan, and how to file a complaint if you are not satisfied with a decision or treatment.\\nThe word “coverage” and “covered services” refers to the medical care and services and the \\nprescription drugs available to you as a member of Devoted PRIME (HMO). \\xa0\\nIt’s important for you to learn what the plan’s rules are and what services are available to you. We \\nencourage you to set aside some time to look through this Evidence of Coverage  document. \\xa0\\nIf you are confused, concerned, or just have a question, please contact Member Services.\\nSection 1.3 Legal information about the Evidence of Coverage\\nThis Evidence of Coverage  is part of our contract with you about how Devoted PRIME (HMO) \\ncovers your care. Other parts of this contract include your enrollment form, the List of Covered \\nDrugs (Formulary) , and any notices you receive from us about changes to your coverage or \\n\\nPage_9: \\n9 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•conditions that affect your coverage. These notices are sometimes called “riders” or \\n“amendments.” \\xa0\\nThe contract is in effect for months in which you are enrolled in Devoted PRIME (HMO) between \\nJanuary 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. \\xa0\\nEach calendar year, Medicare allows us to make changes to the plans that we offer. This means \\nwe can change the costs and benefits of Devoted PRIME (HMO) after December 31, 2023. We can \\nalso choose to stop offering the plan in your service area, after December 31, 2023. \\xa0\\nMedicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) must approve Devoted PRIME (HMO) \\neach year. You can continue each year to get Medicare coverage as a member of our plan as long \\nas we choose to continue to offer the plan and Medicare renews its approval of the plan.\\nSECTION 2 What makes you eligible to be a plan member?\\nSection 2.1 Your eligibility requirements\\nYou are eligible for membership in our plan as long as:\\nYou have both Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B\\n-- and --  you live in our geographic service area  (Section 2.2 below describes our service \\narea). Incarcerated individuals are not considered living in the geographic service area even \\nif they are physically located in it.\\n-- and -- you are a United States citizen or are lawfully present in the United States.\\nSection 2.2 Here is the plan service area for Devoted PRIME (HMO)\\nDevoted PRIME (HMO) is available only to individuals who live in our plan service area. To remain \\na member of our plan, you must continue to reside in the plan service area. The service area is \\ndescribed below. \\xa0\\nOur service area includes this county/counties in Florida: Miami-Dade.\\nWe offer coverage in several states and other counties in Florida . However, there may be cost or \\nother differences between the plans we offer in each state or county. If you move out of state and \\ninto a state that is still within our service area, you must call Member Services in order to update \\nyour information.\\nIf you plan to move out of the service area, you cannot remain a member of this plan. Please \\ncontact Member Services to see if we have a plan in your new area. When you move, you will have \\n\\nPage_10: \\n10 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\na Special Enrollment Period that will allow you to switch to Original Medicare or enroll in a \\nMedicare health or drug plan that is available in your new location.\\nIt is also important that you call Social Security if you move or change your mailing address. You \\ncan find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in Chapter 2, Section \\xa05.\\nSection 2.3 U.S. Citizen or Lawful Presence\\nA member of a Medicare health plan must be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United \\nStates. Medicare (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) will notify Devoted PRIME (HMO) \\nif you are not eligible to remain a member on this basis. Devoted PRIME (HMO) must disenroll \\nyou if you do not meet this requirement.\\nSECTION 3 Important Membership Materials You Will Receive\\nSection 3.1 Your plan membership card\\nWhile you are a member of our plan, you must use your membership card whenever you get any \\nservices covered by this plan and for prescription drugs you get at network pharmacies. You \\nshould also show the provider your Medicaid card, if applicable. Here’s a sample membership \\ncard to show you what yours will look like:\\n \\n\\n\\nPage_11: \\n11 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n \\nDo NOT  use your red, white, and blue Medicare card for covered medical services while you are a \\nmember of this plan. \\xa0If you use your Medicare card instead of your Devoted PRIME (HMO) \\nmembership card, you may have to pay the full cost of medical services yourself. Keep your \\nMedicare card in a safe place. \\xa0You may be asked to show it if you need hospital services, hospice \\nservices, or participate in Medicare approved clinical research studies, also called clinical trials.\\nIf your plan membership card is damaged, lost, or stolen, call Member Services right away and we \\nwill send you a new card. \\xa0\\nSection 3.2 The Devoted Health Provider & Pharmacy Directory\\nThe Devoted Health  Provider & Pharmacy Directory  lists our network providers and pharmacies.\\nNetwork providers  are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, durable \\nmedical equipment suppliers, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement \\nwith us to accept our payment and any plan cost sharing as payment in full.\\nNetwork pharmacies  are all of the pharmacies that have agreed to fill covered prescriptions for \\nour plan members. You can use the Devoted Health Provider &  Pharmacy Directory  to find the \\nnetwork pharmacy you want to use. See Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for information on when you can \\nuse pharmacies that are not in the plan’s network.\\nYou must use network providers to get your medical care and services. If you go elsewhere \\nwithout proper authorization you will have to pay in full. The only exceptions are emergencies, \\nurgently needed services when the network is not available (that is, in situations when it is \\nunreasonable or not possible to obtain services in-network), out-of-area dialysis services, and \\ncases in which Devoted PRIME (HMO) authorizes use of out-of-network providers. \\xa0\\xa0If you don’t \\nhave your copy of the Devoted Health Provider & Pharmacy Directory , you can request a copy \\nfrom Member Services. You can also find this information on our website at www.devoted.com, or \\ndownload it from this website. Both Member Services and the website can give you the most up-  \\nto-date information about changes in our network providers.\\nSection 3.3 The plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)\\nThe plan has a List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) . We call it the “Drug List” for short. It tells \\nwhich Part D prescription drugs are covered under the Part D benefit included in Devoted PRIME \\n(HMO). The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and \\npharmacists. The list must meet requirements set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the \\nDevoted PRIME (HMO) Drug List.\\nThe Drug List also tells you if there are any rules that restrict coverage for your drugs.\\n\\nPage_12: \\n12 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•We will provide you a copy of the Drug List. To get the most complete and current information \\nabout which drugs are covered, you can visit the plan’s website (www.devoted.com) or call \\nMember Services.\\nSECTION 4 Your monthly costs for Devoted PRIME (HMO)\\nYour costs may include the following:\\nPlan Premium (Section 4.1)\\nMonthly Medicare Part B Premium (Section 4.2)\\nPart D Late Enrollment Penalty (Section 4.3)\\nIncome Related Monthly Adjusted Amount (Section 4.4)\\nIn some situations, your plan premium could be less . \\nThe “Extra Help” program helps people with limited resources pay for their drugs. Chapter 2, \\nSection 7, tells more about this program. If you qualify, enrolling in the program might lower your \\nmonthly plan premium.\\nIf you are already enrolled  and getting help from one of these programs, the information about \\npremiums in this Evidence of Coverage  may  not apply to you . We sent you a separate insert, \\ncalled the “Evidence of Coverage Rider for People Who Get Extra Help Paying for Prescription \\nDrugs” (also known as the “Low Income Subsidy Rider” or the “LIS Rider”), which tells you about \\nyour drug coverage. If you don’t have this insert, please call Member Services and ask for the “LIS \\nRider.”\\nMedicare Part B and Part D premiums differ for people with different incomes. If you have \\nquestions about these premiums, review your copy of Medicare & You  2023  handbook, the \\nsection called “2023 Medicare Costs.” If you need a copy you can download it from the Medicare \\nwebsite ( www.medicare.gov ). Or, you can order a printed copy by phone at 1-800-MEDICARE \\n(1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048.\\nSection 4.1 Plan premium\\nAs a member of our plan, you pay a monthly plan premium. For 2023, the monthly premium for \\nDevoted PRIME (HMO) is $32. \\xa0\\nSection 4.2 Monthly Medicare Part B Premium\\nMany members are required to pay other Medicare premiums.  \\n \\n\\nPage_13: \\n13 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•In addition to paying the monthly plan premium, you must continue paying your Medicare \\npremiums to remain a member of the plan. This includes your premium for Part B. It may also \\ninclude a premium for Part A which affects members who aren’t eligible for premium free Part A.\\nSection 4.3 Part D Late Enrollment Penalty\\nSome members are required to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty . The Part D late enrollment \\npenalty is an additional premium that must be paid for Part D coverage if at any time after your \\ninitial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 days or more in a row when you did not \\nhave Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. “Creditable prescription drug \\ncoverage” is coverage that meets Medicare’s minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on \\naverage, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. The cost of the late \\nenrollment penalty depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription \\ndrug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage. The Part \\nD late enrollment penalty is added to your monthly premium. When you first enroll in Devoted \\nPRIME (HMO) , we let you know the amount of the penalty. \\xa0\\nYou will not  have to pay it if:\\nYou receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs.\\nYou have gone less than 63 days in a row without creditable coverage.\\nYou have had creditable drug coverage through another source such as a former employer, \\nunion, TRICARE, or Department of Veterans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources \\ndepartment will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This \\ninformation may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep \\nthis information, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later.\\nNote:  Any notice must state that you had “creditable” prescription drug coverage that is \\nexpected to pay as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug plan pays.\\nNote:  The following are not creditable prescription drug coverage: prescription drug \\ndiscount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites. \\xa0\\nMedicare determines the amount of the penalty.  Here is how it works:\\nIf you went 63 days or more without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage \\nafter you were first eligible to enroll in Part D, the plan will count the number of full months \\nthat you did not have coverage. The penalty is 1% for every month that you did not have \\ncreditable coverage. For example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be \\n14%.\\nThen Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug \\nplans in the nation from the previous year. For 2023, this average premium amount is \\n$32.74 .\\nTo calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average \\nmonthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In the example here it would be \\n14% times $32.74, which equals $4.58. This rounds to $4.60. This amount would be added  \\nto the monthly premium for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty .\\n\\nPage_14: \\n14 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•There are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment penalty:\\nFirst, the penalty may change each year , because the average monthly premium can \\nchange each year. \\xa0\\nSecond, you will continue to pay a penalty  every month for as long as you are enrolled in a \\nplan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you change plans.\\nThird, if you are under  65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the Part D late \\nenrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your Part D late enrollment \\npenalty will be based only on the months that you don’t have coverage after your initial \\nenrollment period for aging into Medicare.\\nIf you disagree about your Part D late enrollment penalty, you or your representative can ask \\nfor a review. Generally, you must request this review within 60 days  from the date on the first \\nletter you receive stating you have to pay a late enrollment penalty. However, if you were paying \\na penalty before joining our plan, you may not have another chance to request a review of that \\nlate enrollment penalty. \\xa0\\nSection 4.4 Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount\\nSome members may be required to pay an extra charge, known as the Part D Income Related \\nMonthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. The extra charge is figured out using your \\nmodified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago. If this \\namount is above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard premium amount and the additional \\nIRMAA. For more information on the extra amount you may have to pay based on your income, \\nvisit https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d/costs-for-medicare-drug-coverage/  \\nmonthly-premium-for-drug-plans .\\nIf you have to pay an extra amount, Social Security, not your Medicare plan, will send you a letter \\ntelling you what that extra amount will be. The extra amount will be withheld from your Social \\nSecurity, Railroad Retirement Board, or Office of Personnel Management benefit check, no matter \\nhow you usually pay your plan premium, unless your monthly benefit isn’t enough to cover the \\nextra amount owed. If your benefit check isn’t enough to cover the extra amount, you will get a \\nbill from Medicare. You must pay the extra amount to the government. It cannot be paid with \\nyour monthly plan premium. If you do not pay the extra amount you will be disenrolled from \\nthe plan and lose prescription drug coverage.\\nIf you disagree about paying an extra amount, you can ask Social Security to review the decision. \\nTo find out more about how to do this, contact Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY \\n1-800-325-0778).\\nSECTION 5 More information about your monthly premium\\n\\nPage_15: \\n15 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 5.1 There are several ways you can pay your plan premium\\nThere are 3 ways you can pay your plan premium.\\nIf you\\'d like to change your payment option, call Member Services at 1-800-DEVOTED \\n(1-800-338-6833) TTY 711.\\nIf you decide to change the way you pay your premium, it can take up to three months for your \\nnew payment method to take effect.

If you choose this \\noption, your invoice is generated by the 5th of each month, and payment for your plan premium \\nand/or Part D late enrollment penalty is due upon receipt. Your premium/Part D late enrollment \\npenalty will be due monthly.\\nPlease make sure you follow these steps so there are no delays in processing your payments:\\nMake your check out to Devoted Health. You can also use a money order if you don\\'t have a \\nchecking account.\\nAlways include the invoice along with your payment and use the reply envelope.

If the monthly plan premium changes for next year we will tell you in September \\nand the change will take effect on January 1.\\nHowever, in some cases the part of the premium that you have to pay can change during the year. \\nThis happens if you become eligible for the “Extra Help” program or if you lose your eligibility for \\nthe “Extra Help” program during the year. If a member qualifies for “Extra Help” with their \\nprescription drug costs, the “Extra Help” program will pay part of the member’s monthly plan \\npremium. A member who loses their eligibility during the year will need to start paying their full \\nmonthly premium. You can find out more about the “Extra Help” program in Chapter 2, Section \\xa07.\\nSECTION 6 Keeping your plan membership record up to date\\nYour membership record has information from your enrollment form, including your address and \\ntelephone number. It shows your specific plan coverage including your Primary Care Provider. \\xa0\\nThe doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and other providers in the plan’s network need to have \\ncorrect information about you. These network providers use your membership record to know \\nwhat services and drugs are covered and the cost-sharing amounts for you . Because of this, it \\nis very important that you help us keep your information up to date.\\n\\nPage_17: \\n17 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Let us know about these changes:\\nChanges to your name, your address, or your phone number\\nChanges in any other health insurance coverage you have (such as from your employer, your \\nspouse’s employer, Workers’ Compensation, or Medicaid)\\nIf you have any liability claims, such as claims from an automobile accident\\nIf you have been admitted to a nursing home\\nIf you receive care in an out-of-area or out-of-network hospital or emergency room\\nIf your designated responsible party (such as a caregiver) changes\\nIf you are participating in a clinical research study ( Note:  You are not required to tell your \\nplan about the clinical research studies you intend to participate in but we encourage you \\nto do so)\\nIf any of this information changes, please let us know by calling Member Services.\\nIt is also important to contact Social Security if you move or change your mailing address. You \\ncan find phone numbers and contact information for Social Security in Chapter 2, Section 5.\\nSECTION 7 How other insurance works with our plan\\nOther insurance\\nMedicare requires that we collect information from you about any other medical or drug \\ninsurance coverage that you have. That’s because we must coordinate any other coverage you \\nhave with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of Benefits .\\nOnce each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance coverage \\nthat we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct, you don’t need to \\ndo anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other coverage that is not listed, please \\ncall Member Services. You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers \\n(once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time.\\nWhen you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules set by \\nMedicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays \\nfirst is called the “primary payer” and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays \\nsecond, called the “secondary payer,” only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary \\ncoverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. If you have other \\ninsurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy.\\nThese rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage:\\nIf you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first.\\nIf your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member’s current \\nemployment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your \\nemployer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal \\nDisease (ESRD):\\n\\nPage_18: \\n18 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 1 : Getting started as a member\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•If you’re under 65 and disabled and you or your family member are still working, your \\ngroup health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one \\nemployer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees.\\nIf you’re over 65 and you or your spouse are still working, your group health plan pays \\nfirst if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple \\nemployer plan that has more than 20 employees.\\nIf you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 \\nmonths after you become eligible for Medicare.\\nThese types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type:\\nNo-fault insurance (including automobile insurance)\\nLiability (including automobile insurance)\\nBlack lung benefits\\nWorkers’ compensation\\nMedicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare-covered services. They only pay after \\nMedicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.\\n\\nPage_19: \\nCHAPTER 2 : \\nImportant phone numbers and resources\\n\\nPage_20: \\n20 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 2 : Important phone numbers and resources\\nSECTION 1 Devoted PRIME (HMO) contacts  \\n(how to contact us, including how to reach Member Services) \\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHow to contact our plan’s Member Services\\nFor assistance with claims, billing, or member card questions, please call or write to Devoted \\nPRIME (HMO) Member Services.

It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the \\nmedical treatments, services, equipment, prescription drugs, and other medical care that are \\ncovered by the plan. \\xa0\\nFor the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get \\nthis care, use the benefits chart in the next chapter, Chapter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart (what is \\ncovered and what you pay) ).\\nSection 1.1 What are “network providers” and “covered services”?\\n“Providers” are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to \\nprovide medical services and care. The term “providers” also includes hospitals and other \\nhealth care facilities. \\xa0\\n“Network providers”  are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, \\nhospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our \\npayment and your cost-sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these \\nproviders to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network \\nbill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your \\nshare of the cost for their services. \\xa0\\n“Covered services”  include all the medical care, health care services, supplies equipment, \\nand Prescription Drugs that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care \\nare listed in the benefits chart in Chapter 4. Your covered services for prescription drugs \\nare discussed in Chapter 5.\\nSection 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan\\nAs a Medicare health plan, Devoted PRIME (HMO) must cover all services covered by Original \\nMedicare and must follow Original Medicare’s coverage rules.\\nDevoted PRIME (HMO) will generally cover your medical care as long as:\\nThe care you receive is included in the plan’s Medical Benefits Chart  (this chart is in \\nChapter 4 of this document).\\n\\nPage_36: \\n36 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\n•\\n•\\n•The care you receive is considered medically necessary . “Medically necessary” means \\nthat the services, supplies, equipment, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or \\ntreatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.\\nYou have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your \\ncare.  As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about \\nthis, see Section 2.1 in this chapter).\\nIn most situations, your network PCP must give you approval in advance before you \\ncan use other providers in the plan’s network, such as specialists, hospitals, skilled \\nnursing facilities, or home health care agencies. This is called giving you a “referral.” \\nFor more information about this, see Section 2.3 of this chapter.\\nReferrals from your PCP are not required for emergency care or urgently needed \\nservices. There are also some other kinds of care you can get without having approval \\nin advance from your PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.2 of this \\nchapter).\\nYou must receive your care from a network provider  (for more information about this, see  \\nSection 2 in this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out-of-network provider \\n(a provider who is not part of our plan’s network) will not be covered. This means that you \\nwill have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished. Here are three exceptions:\\nThe plan covers emergency care or urgently needed services that you get from an out-  \\nof-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or \\nurgently needed services means, see Section 3 in this chapter.\\nIf you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover but there are no \\nspecialists in our network that provide this care, you can get this care from an out-of-  \\nnetwork provider at the same cost sharing you normally pay in-network. \\n\\xa0Authorization is required prior to obtaining these services. Call Member Services at \\n1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY 711 to obtain authorization for these services. \\nAuthorization is required prior to obtaining care out-of-network (except in medical \\nemergencies, in which case you should reach out after being stabilized). In this \\nsituation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network \\nprovider. For information about getting approval to see an out-of-network doctor, see \\nSection 2.4 in this chapter.\\nThe plan covers kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare-certified dialysis \\nfacility when you are temporarily outside the plan’s service area or when your provider \\nfor this service is temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The cost sharing you pay \\nthe plan for dialysis can never exceed the cost sharing in Original Medicare. If you are \\noutside the plan’s service area and obtain the dialysis from a provider that is outside \\nthe plan’s network, your cost sharing cannot exceed the cost sharing you pay in-  \\nnetwork. However, if your usual in-network provider for dialysis is temporarily \\nunavailable and you choose to obtain services inside the service area from a provider \\noutside the plan’s network the cost sharing for the dialysis may be higher.\\nSECTION 2 Use providers in the plan’s network to get your medical care\\n\\nPage_37: \\n37 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 2.1 You must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and \\noversee your medical care\\nWhat is a “PCP” and what does the PCP do for you?\\nA “PCP” is your Primary Care Provider. When you become a member of our plan, you must choose \\na plan provider to be your PCP. Your PCP is a provider who meets state requirements and is \\ntrained to give you basic medical care. You will get your routine or basic care from your PCP. Your \\nPCP will also coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. In most \\ncases, you will need to have your PCP\\'s approval to see a specialist (this is called getting a \\n\"referral\" to a specialist). Your PCP will provide most of your care and will help to arrange or \\ncoordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. This includes:\\nRadiology (for example, X-rays or MRIs)\\nLaboratory tests\\nTherapies (for example, physical therapy)\\nCare from doctors who are specialists\\nOutpatient procedures\\nHospital admissions (except when it\\'s an emergency; see section 3.1 of this chapter), and\\nFollow-up care after a hospital admission or procedure\\n“Coordinating” your services includes checking or consulting with other plan providers about \\nyour care and how it is going. If you need certain types of covered services or supplies, you must \\nget approval in advance from your PCP (such as giving you a referral to see a specialist). In some \\ncases, your PCP will need to get prior authorization (prior approval) from us. Since your PCP will \\nprovide and coordinate your medical care, you should have all your past medical records sent to \\nyour PCP’s office. Chapter 8 tells you how we will protect the privacy of your medical records and \\npersonal health information.\\nHow do you choose your PCP?\\nIf you already have a PCP, verify that your PCP is covered in the Devoted Health network by \\nchecking that they are listed in the Devoted Health Provider & Pharmacy Directory, which is \\navailable at www.devoted.com. Next, call Member Services to officially make them your PCP, by \\ncalling 1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY 711. \\xa0\\nIf your current PCP is not in network, or if you do not have a PCP, you can call Member Services at \\n1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY 711 if you would like help identifying a PCP.\\nChanging your PCP\\nYou may change your PCP for any reason, at any time.

We can help you select a new PCP who is a good \\nmatch for you, or if you already have someone in mind we can officially record that for you. \\xa0\\nThe date that your PCP change goes into effect will vary based on when you request the change:\\nIf you request a change on or before the 9th of a month and have not yet seen your PCP that \\nmonth : you may choose to have the change go into effective retroactive to the 1st of that \\nmonth or the 1st of the following month.\\nIf you request a change on or after the 10th of a month or you have already seen your PCP \\nthat month : the change will be effective the 1st day of the next month.\\nUnder certain circumstances, if you request a change on or after the 10th of a month, you may \\nhave your change made effective retroactive to the 1st of that month, as an exception to the \\npolicy above. These exception circumstances are:\\nYou are not an established patient with your current PCP (have not had a visit with this PCP \\nbefore)\\nYour current PCP is no longer in the Devoted Health network\\nDevoted Health made an error affecting your current PCP selection\\nAll claims will be processed based on who your PCP was at the time of service. \\xa0If you need care \\nfrom specialists or hospitals, your PCP will refer you to a specialist or hospital who they work \\nwith and can help to coordinate care. \\xa0If you have any open referrals at the time you change PCPs, \\nmake sure you get a new referral from your new PCP.\\nSection 2.2 What kinds of medical care can you get without a referral from \\nyour PCP?\\nYou can get the services listed below without getting approval in advance from your PCP.\\nRoutine women’s health care, which includes breast exams, screening mammograms (x-  \\nrays of the breast), Pap tests, and pelvic exams as long as you get them from a network \\nprovider.\\nFlu shots, COVID-19 vaccinations, Hepatitis B vaccinations, and pneumonia vaccinations as \\nlong as you get them from a network provider\\nEmergency services from network providers or from out-of-network providers\\nUrgently needed services are covered services that are not emergency services, provided \\nwhen the network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible or when the \\nenrollee is out of the service area.

There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples:\\nOncologists care for patients with cancer.\\nCardiologists care for patients with heart conditions.\\nOrthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions.\\nWhen your PCP thinks you need specialized treatment, he/she will give you a referral (your PCP’s \\napproval) to see a specialist or certain other providers in our network. \\xa0\\nIt is important to get a referral (your PCP’s approval) in advance from your PCP before you see a \\nplan specialist or certain other providers. (see the previous section for more details on \\nexceptions to this rule).\\nIf the specialist wants you to come back for more care, check first to be sure that the referral you \\ngot from your PCP for the first visit covers more visits to the specialist.\\nIf there are specific specialists you want to use, find out first whether they are in the Devoted \\nHealth network. Each plan PCP may have certain specialists they prefer to refer patients to. \\xa0This \\nmeans that the PCP you select may determine the specialists you may see. Please consult with \\nyour PCP. \\xa0\\nNetwork providers are doctors and other health care professionals that have an agreement with \\nDevoted Health to provide covered services to members in our plan.

See Chapter 4, Section 2 (Medical \\nBenefits Chart) for details.\\nWhen you are temporarily outside the plan’s service area but remain in the United States \\nand its territories, we will cover kidney dialysis services from a Medicare-certified dialysis \\nfacility.\\nIn the plan’s service area, you may receive any Medicare-covered service that the plan’s \\nnetwork of doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and \\nother health care facilities cannot provide. However, prior authorization from the plan is \\nrequired, and we recommend that you get a referral from your PCP before receiving care \\nout-of-network.

The \\nmedical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly \\ngetting worse.\\nIf you have a medical emergency:\\nGet help as quickly as possible.  Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or \\nhospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval or a referral \\nfirst from your PCP. You do not need to use a network doctor. You may get covered \\nemergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its \\nterritories, and from any provider with an appropriate state license even if they are not part \\nof our network. You are also covered for urgent and emergency services anywhere in the \\nworld.  \\nAs soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency.  We \\nneed to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about \\nyour emergency care, usually within 48 hours. Call us at 1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) \\nTTY 711 from 8am to 8pm, 7 days a week, from October 1 to March 31, and 8am to 8pm, \\nMonday to Friday, April 1 to September 30 so we can help.  \\nWhat is covered if you have a medical emergency?\\nOur plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any \\nother way could endanger your health. We also cover medical services during the emergency. \\xa0\\nThe doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the \\nmedical emergency is over.\\n\\nPage_42: \\n42 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\n•\\n•You are covered for emergency care world-wide. If you have an emergency outside of the U.S. and \\nits territories, you will be responsible to pay for the services rendered upfront. We will reimburse \\nyou for covered costs up to the amount set by the Medicare fee schedule. For more information \\nplease see the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1, or call us at 1-800-DEVOTED \\n(1-800-338-6833) TTY 711.\\nAfter the emergency is over you are entitled to follow-up care to be sure your condition continues \\nto be stable. Your doctors will continue to treat you until your doctors contact us and make plans \\nfor additional care. Your follow-up care will be covered by our plan.\\nIf your emergency care is provided by out-of-network providers, we will try to arrange for network \\nproviders to take over your care as soon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow.\\nWhat if it wasn’t a medical emergency?\\nSometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in \\nfor emergency care – thinking that your health is in serious danger – and the doctor may say that \\nit wasn’t a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you \\nreasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care.\\nHowever, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care \\nonly  if you get the additional care in one of these two ways:\\nYou go to a network provider to get the additional care. \\xa0\\n– or –  The additional care you get is considered “urgently needed services” and you follow \\nthe rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see \\xa0Section 3.2 \\nbelow).\\nSection 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for services\\nWhat are “urgently needed services”?\\nAn urgently needed service is a non-emergency situation requiring immediate medical care but, \\ngiven your circumstances, it is not possible or not reasonable to obtain these services from a \\nnetwork provider. The plan must cover urgently needed services provided out of network. Some \\nexamples of urgently needed services are i) a severe sore throat that occurs over the weekend or \\nii) an unforeseen flare-up of a known condition when you are temporarily outside the service area.\\nYou should always try to obtain urgently needed services from network providers. However, if \\nproviders are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible and it is not reasonable to wait to obtain \\ncare from your network provider when the network becomes available, we will cover urgently \\nneeded services that you get from an out-of-network provider. If you need urgent care, go to any \\nurgent care clinic or urgent care center.\\nWhen you cannot get care from a network provider, our plan will cover urgently needed services \\nthat you get from any provider.\\n\\nPage_43: \\n43 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\nOur plan covers worldwide emergency and urgent care services outside the United States. If you \\nhave an urgent need for care outside of the U.S. and its territories, you will be responsible for \\npaying for the services rendered upfront. We will reimburse you for all the relevant covered costs. \\nFor more information please see Chapter 4 or call us at 1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY \\n711.\\nSection 3.3 Getting care during a disaster\\nIf the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President \\nof the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are \\nstill entitled to care from your plan.\\nPlease visit the following website: www.devoted.com for information on how to obtain needed \\ncare during a disaster .\\nIf you cannot use a network provider during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care \\nfrom out-of-network providers at in-network cost sharing. If you cannot use a network pharmacy \\nduring a disaster, you may be able to fill your prescription drugs at an out-of-network pharmacy. \\nPlease see Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for more information.\\nSECTION 4 What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your covered \\nservices?\\nSection 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services\\nIf you have paid more than your plan cost-sharing for covered services, or if you have received a \\nbill for the full cost of covered medical services, go to Chapter 7 ( Asking us to pay our share of a \\nbill you have received for covered medical services or drugs ) for information about what to do.\\nSection 4.2 If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost\\nDevoted PRIME (HMO) covers all medically necessary services as listed in the Medical Benefits \\nChart in Chapter 4 of this document. If you receive services not covered by our plan or services \\nobtained out-of-network and were not authorized, you are responsible for paying the full cost of \\nservices. \\xa0\\nFor covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you \\nget after you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service. Paying for costs once a \\n\\nPage_44: \\n44 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\nbenefit limit has been reached does not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. You can call \\nMember Services when you want to know how much of your benefit limit you have already used.\\nSECTION 5 How are your medical services covered when you are in a \\n“clinical research study”?\\nSection 5.1 What is a “clinical research study”?\\nA clinical research study (also called a “clinical trial”) is a way that doctors and scientists test \\nnew types of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research \\nstudies are approved by Medicare. Clinical research studies approved by Medicare typically \\nrequest volunteers to participate in the study. \\xa0\\nOnce Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study \\nwill contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the \\nscientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the \\nrequirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved \\nif you participate in the study.\\nIf you participate in a Medicare-approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the \\ncovered services you receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical \\ntrial, then you are only responsible for the in-network cost sharing for the services in that trial. If \\nyou paid more, for example, if you already paid the Original Medicare cost-sharing amount, we \\nwill reimburse the difference between what you paid and the in-network cost sharing. However, \\nyou will need to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When you are in a clinical \\nresearch study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the \\ncare that is not related to the study) through our plan.\\nIf you want to participate in any Medicare-approved clinical research study, you do not need to \\ntell us or to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the \\nclinical research study do not need to be part of our plan’s network of providers.\\nAlthough you do not need to get our plan’s permission to be in a clinical research study, we \\nencourage you to notify us in advance when you choose to participate in Medicare-qualified \\nclinical trials.\\nIf you participate in a study that Medicare has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all \\ncosts for your participation in the study .\\n\\nPage_45: \\n45 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 5.2 When you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for \\nwhat?\\nOnce you join a Medicare-approved clinical research study, Original Medicare covers the routine \\nitems and services you receive as part of the study, including:\\nRoom and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren’t in a \\nstudy.\\nAn operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study.\\nTreatment of side effects and complications of the new care.\\nAfter Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will pay the difference \\nbetween the cost sharing in Original Medicare and your in-network cost sharing as a member of \\nour plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the \\nstudy as you would if you received these services from our plan. However, you are required to \\nsubmit documentation showing how much cost sharing you paid. Please see Chapter 7 for more \\ninformation for submitting requests for payments. \\xa0\\nHere’s an example of how the cost-sharing works:  Let’s say that you have a lab test \\nthat costs $100 as part of the research study. Let’s also say that your share of the \\ncosts for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our \\nplan’s benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and you \\nwould pay the $20 copay required under Original Medicare. You would then notify \\nyour plan that you received a qualified clinical trial service and submit documentation \\nsuch as a provider bill to the plan. The plan would then directly pay you $10. \\nTherefore, your net payment is $10, the same amount you would pay under our plan’s \\nbenefits. Please note that in order to receive payment from your plan, you must \\nsubmit documentation to your plan such as a provider bill.\\nWhen you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of \\nthe following:\\nGenerally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless \\nMedicare would cover the item or service even if you were not in a study.\\nItems or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For \\nexample, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your \\nmedical condition would normally require only one CT scan.\\nDo you want to know more?\\nYou can get more information about joining a clinical research study by visiting the Medicare \\nwebsite to read or download the publication “Medicare and Clinical Research Studies.” (The \\npublication is available at: www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical-Research-  \\nStudies.pdf .)

If getting care in a hospital or a \\nskilled nursing facility is against a member’s religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for \\ncare in a religious non-medical health care institution. This benefit is provided only for Part A \\ninpatient services (non-medical health care services).\\nSection 6.2 Receiving Care from a Religious Non-Medical Health Care \\nInstitution\\nTo get care from a religious non-medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document \\nthat says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is “non-excepted.”\\n“Non-excepted” medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is \\nvoluntary  and not required  by any federal, state, or local law. \\xa0\\n“Excepted” medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not \\nvoluntary or is required  under federal, state, or local law.\\nTo be covered by our plan, the care you get from a religious non-medical health care institution \\nmust meet the following conditions:\\nThe facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare.\\nOur plan’s coverage of services you receive is limited to non-religious  aspects of care.\\nIf you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following \\nconditions apply:\\nYou must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services \\nfor inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility care.\\n– and – you must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to \\nthe facility or your stay will not be covered.\\nYou are covered for an unlimited number of medically necessary inpatient hospital days. See \\nChapter 4 (Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)) for details.\\nSECTION 7 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment\\n\\nPage_47: \\n47 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 7.1 Will you own the durable medical equipment after making a \\ncertain number of payments under our plan?\\nDurable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, \\nwheelchairs, walkers, powered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating \\ndevices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, and hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the \\nhome. The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we discuss \\nother types of DME that you must rent.\\nIn Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying \\ncopayments for the item for 13 months. As a member of Devoted PRIME (HMO), the same rules \\napply. People who rent the relevant types of DME own the equipment after paying copayments \\nfor the item for 13 months. This means that if after we transfer ownership and something breaks \\nyou are responsible for the costs of repairing or replacing it. \\xa0\\nWhat happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original \\nMedicare?\\nIf you did not acquire ownership of the DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new \\nconsecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. The \\npayments made while enrolled in your plan do not count. \\xa0\\nExample 1: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then \\njoined our plan. The payments you made in Original Medicare do not count. You will have to make \\n13 payments to our plan before owning the item.\\nExample 2: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and \\nthen joined our plan. You were in our plan but did not obtain ownership while in our plan. You \\nthen go back to Original Medicare. You will have to make 13 consecutive new payments to own \\nthe item once you join Original Medicare again. All previous payments (whether to our plan or to \\nOriginal Medicare) do not count. \\xa0\\nSection 7.2 Rules for oxygen equipment, supplies, and maintenance \\xa0\\nWhat oxygen benefits are you entitled to?\\nIf you qualify for Medicare oxygen equipment coverage Devoted PRIME (HMO) will cover:\\nRental of oxygen equipment\\nDelivery of oxygen and oxygen contents\\nTubing and related oxygen accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents\\nMaintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment\\n\\nPage_48: \\n48 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 3 : Using the plan for your medical services\\nIf you leave Devoted PRIME (HMO) or no longer medically require oxygen equipment, then the \\noxygen equipment must be returned to the owner.\\nWhat happens if you leave your plan and return to Original Medicare? \\xa0\\nOriginal Medicare requires an oxygen supplier to provide you services for five years. During the \\nfirst 36 months you rent the equipment. The remaining 24 months the supplier provides the \\nequipment and maintenance (you are still responsible for the copayment for oxygen). After five \\nyears you may choose to stay with the same company or go to another company. At this point, \\nthe five-year cycle begins again, even if you remain with the same company, requiring you to pay \\ncopayments for the first 36 months. If you join or leave our plan, the five-year cycle starts over.\\n\\nPage_49: \\nCHAPTER 4 : \\nMedical Benefits Chart (what is covered and \\nwhat you pay)\\n\\nPage_50: \\n50 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 4 : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n•\\n•SECTION 1 Understanding your out-of-pocket costs for covered services\\nThis chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart that lists your covered services and shows how \\nmuch you will pay for each covered service as a member of Devoted PRIME (HMO). \\xa0It also \\ndescribes supplemental benefits you receive. Later in this chapter, you can find information \\nabout medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services.\\nSection 1.1 Types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered \\nservices\\nTo understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the \\ntypes of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services.\\nA “copayment”  is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. \\nYou pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart \\nin Section 2 tells you more about your copayments.)\\n“Coinsurance”  is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You \\npay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in \\nSection 2 tells you more about your coinsurance.)\\nMost people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program \\nshould never pay deductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of \\nMedicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider, if applicable.\\nSection 1.2 What is the most you will pay for Medicare Part A and Part B \\ncovered medical services?\\nBecause you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit on the total amount you \\nhave to pay out-of-pocket each year for in-network medical services that are covered under \\nMedicare Part A and Part B. This limit is called the maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP) amount for \\nmedical services. For calendar year 2023 this amount is $2,900.\\nThe amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for in-network covered services count \\ntoward this maximum out-of-pocket amount. The amounts you pay for your plan premiums and \\nfor your Part D prescription drugs do not count toward your maximum out-of-pocket amount. If \\nyou reach the maximum out-of-pocket amount of $2,900, you will not have to pay any out-of-  \\npocket costs for the rest of the year for in-network covered Part A and Part B services. However, \\n\\nPage_51: \\n51 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 4 : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)\\n•\\n•\\n•you must continue to pay your plan premium and the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part \\nB premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party).\\nSection 1.3 Our plan does not allow providers to “balance bill” you\\nAs a member of Devoted PRIME (HMO), an important protection for you is that you only have to \\npay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add \\nadditional separate charges, called “balance billing.” This protection applies even if we pay the \\nprovider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don’t \\npay certain provider charges.\\nHere is how this protection works. \\xa0\\nIf your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you \\npay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. \\xa0\\nIf your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay \\nmore than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see:\\nIf you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance \\npercentage multiplied by the plan’s reimbursement rate (as determined in the \\ncontract between the provider and the plan).\\nIf you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates \\nwith Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare \\npayment rate for participating providers. (Remember, the plan covers services from \\nout-of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get a referral or \\nfor emergencies or urgently needed services.)\\nIf you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who does not \\nparticipate with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the \\nMedicare payment rate for non-participating providers. (Remember, the plan covers \\nservices from out-of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you \\nget a referral, or for emergencies or urgently needed services.)\\nIf you believe a provider has “balance billed” you, call Member Services.\\nSECTION 2 Use the Medical Benefits Chart  to find out what is covered for \\nyou and how much you will pay\\nSection 2.1 Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan\\nThe Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Devoted PRIME (HMO) covers \\nand what you pay out-of-pocket for each service.

In most cases, care you receive from an out-  \\nof-network provider will not be covered, unless it is emergent or urgent care or unless your \\nplan or a network provider has given you a referral. This means that you will have to pay the \\nprovider in full for the services furnished.\\nYou have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. In most \\nsituations, your PCP must give you approval in advance before you can see other providers \\nin the plan’s network. This is called giving you a “referral.”\\nSome of the services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only  if your doctor or \\nother network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called “prior authorization”) \\nfrom us. Covered services that need approval in advance are marked in the Medical Benefits \\nChart.\\nOther important things to know about our coverage:\\nLike all Medicare health plans, we cover everything that Original Medicare covers.

Please see Chapter 4 for \\nMedicare Part B drug benefits and hospice drug benefits. \\xa0\\nSection 1.1 Basic rules for the plan’s Part D drug coverage\\nThe plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:\\nYou must have a provider (a doctor, dentist, or other prescriber) write you a prescription \\nwhich must be valid under applicable state law. \\xa0\\nYour prescriber must not be on Medicare’s Exclusion or Preclusion Lists.\\nYou generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 2, Fill \\nyour prescription at a network pharmacy  or through the plan’s mail-order service. )\\nYour drug must be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)  (we call it the “Drug \\nList” for short). (See Section 3, Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List .”)\\nYour drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A “medically accepted \\nindication” is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration \\nor supported by certain reference books. (See Section 3 for more information about a \\nmedically accepted indication.)\\nSECTION 2 Fill your prescription at a network pharmacy or through the \\nplan’s mail-order service\\nSection 2.1 Use a network pharmacy\\nIn most cases, your prescriptions are covered only  if they are filled at the plan’s network \\npharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at \\nout-of-network pharmacies.)\\nA network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered \\nprescription drugs. The term “covered drugs” means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are \\non the plan’s Drug List.\\n\\nPage_134: \\n134 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 2.2 Network pharmacies\\nHow do you find a network pharmacy in your area?\\nTo find a network pharmacy, you can look in your Devoted Health Provider & Pharmacy Directory , \\nvisit our website (www.devoted.com), and/or call Member Services.\\nYou may go to any of our network pharmacies.\\nWhat if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network?\\nIf the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find a new \\npharmacy that is in the network. To find another pharmacy in your area, you can get help from \\nMember Services or use the Devoted Health Provider &  Pharmacy Directory . You can also find \\ninformation on our website at www.devoted.com .\\nWhat if you need a specialized pharmacy?\\nSome prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include:\\nPharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy.\\nPharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care (LTC) facility. Usually, a LTC \\nfacility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you have any difficulty accessing \\nyour Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please contact Member Services.\\nPharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program (not \\navailable in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives \\nhave access to these pharmacies in our network. \\xa0\\nPharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain locations or that \\nrequire special handling, provider coordination, or education on their use. ( Note:  This \\nscenario should happen rarely.)\\nTo locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your Devoted Health Provider &  Pharmacy Directory  or \\ncall Member Services. \\xa0\\nSection 2.3 Using the plan’s mail-order service\\nFor certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan’s network mail-order service. Generally, the \\ndrugs provided through mail order are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or \\nlong-term medical condition. The drugs that are not available through the plan’s mail-order \\nservice are marked with \"NM\" (not available at mail-order) in our Drug List.\\nOur plan’s mail-order service allows you to order up to a 100-day supply .\\n\\nPage_135: \\n135 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•To get order forms and information about filling your prescriptions by mail please visit our \\nwebsite www.devoted.com or contact Member Services at 1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY \\n711.\\nUsually a mail-order pharmacy order will be delivered to you in no more than 15 days. If the mail-  \\norder pharmacy expects the order to be delayed, they will contact you and help you decide \\nwhether to wait for the medication, cancel the mail-order, or fill the prescription at a local \\npharmacy. If you need to request a rush order because of a mail-order delay, you may contact \\nMember Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) to discuss \\noptions which may include filling at a local retail pharmacy or expediting the shipping method. \\nProvide the representative with your ID number and prescription number(s). If you want second \\nday or next day delivery of your medications, you may request this from Member Services at \\n1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY 711 for an additional charge.\\nNew prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor’s office.\\nThe pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it receives from health care \\nproviders, without checking with you first, if either:\\nYou used mail order services with this plan in the past, or\\nYou sign up for automatic delivery of all new prescriptions received directly from health \\ncare providers. You may request automatic delivery of all new prescriptions at any time by \\ncalling Member Services (phone numbers are on your member ID card).\\nIf you receive a prescription automatically by mail that you do not want, and you were not \\ncontacted to see if you wanted it before it shipped, you may be eligible for a refund. \\xa0\\nIf you used mail order in the past and do not want the pharmacy to automatically fill and ship \\neach new prescription, please contact us by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed \\non the back cover of this booklet).\\nIf you have never used our mail order delivery and/or decide to stop automatic fills of new \\nprescriptions, the pharmacy will contact you each time it gets a new prescription from a health \\ncare provider to see if you want the medication filled and shipped immediately. It is important \\nthat you respond each time you are contacted by the pharmacy, to let them know whether to \\nship, delay, or cancel the new prescription. \\xa0\\nTo opt out of automatic deliveries of new prescriptions received directly from your health care \\nprovider’s office, please contact us by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed on \\nthe back cover of this booklet).\\nRefills on mail order prescriptions. \\xa0\\nFor refills of your drugs, you have the option to sign up for an automatic refill program . Under this \\nprogram we will start to process your next refill automatically when our records show you should \\nbe close to running out of your drug. The pharmacy will contact you prior to shipping each refill \\n\\nPage_136: \\n136 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n1.\\n2.\\n•to make sure you are in need of more medication, and you can cancel scheduled refills if you have \\nenough of your medication or if your medication has changed. \\xa0\\nIf you choose not to use our auto-refill program but still want the mail-order pharmacy to send \\nyou your prescription, please contact your pharmacy 10  days before your current prescription will \\nrun out. This will ensure your order is shipped to you in time.\\nTo opt out of our program that automatically prepares mail order refills, please contact us by \\ncalling Member Services at 1-800-DEVOTED (1-800-338-6833) TTY 711.\\nIf you receive a refill automatically by mail that you do not want, you may be eligible for a refund.\\nSection 2.4 How can you get a long-term supply of drugs ?\\nWhen you get a long-term supply of drugs, your cost-sharing may be lower. The plan offers two \\nways to get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”) of “maintenance” drugs on our \\nplan’s Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or \\nlong-term medical condition.) You may order this supply through mail order (see Section 2.3) or \\nyou may go to a retail pharmacy\\nSome retail pharmacies in our network allow you to get a long-term supply of maintenance \\ndrugs. Your Devoted Health Provider & Pharmacy Directory  tells you which pharmacies in \\nour network can give you a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. You can also call \\nMember Services for more information.\\nYou may also receive maintenance drugs through our mail-order program. Please see \\nSection 2.3 for more information.\\nSection 2.5 When can you use a pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network?\\nYour prescription may be covered in certain situations\\nGenerally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy only  when you are not able to use \\na network pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside of our service area where \\nyou can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. Please check first with Member \\nServices  to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. You will most likely be required to pay the \\ndifference between what you pay for the drug at the out-of-network pharmacy and the cost that \\nwe would cover at an in-network pharmacy. \\xa0\\nHere are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out-of-network \\npharmacy:\\nMedical emergency: We will cover prescriptions filled at an out-of-network pharmacy in \\nmedical emergency situations.\\n\\nPage_137: \\n137 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•Traveling out-of-network: If you take a prescription drug on a regular basis and you are \\ngoing on a trip, be sure to check your supply of the drug before you leave. When possible, \\ntake along all the medication you will need. You may be able to order your prescription \\ndrugs ahead of time through your network retail or network mail order pharmacy. Contact \\nMember Services if you have additional questions.\\nHow do you ask for reimbursement from the plan?\\nIf you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather \\nthan your normal cost share) at the time you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse \\nyou for our share of the cost. (Chapter 7, Section 2 explains how to ask the plan to pay you back.)\\nSECTION 3 Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List”\\nSection 3.1 The “Drug List” tells which Part D drugs are covered\\nThe plan has a “ List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).”  In this Evidence of Coverage , we call it the \\n“Drug List” for short.\\nThe drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and \\npharmacists. The list meets Medicare\\'s requirements and has been approved by Medicare.\\nThe drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D. \\xa0\\nWe will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the other coverage \\nrules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted indication. A \\n“medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is either :\\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis or condition for which it is \\nbeing prescribed.\\n-- or --  Supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service \\nDrug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.\\nThe Drug List includes brand name drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars.\\nA brand name drug is a prescription drug that is sold under a trademarked name owned by the \\ndrug manufacturer. Brand name drugs that are more complex than typical drugs (for example, \\ndrugs that are based on a protein) are called biological products. On the drug list, when we refer \\nto “drugs,” this could mean a drug or a biological product.\\nA generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name \\ndrug. Since biological products are more complex than typical drugs, instead of having a generic \\nform, they have alternatives that are called biosimilars. Generally, generics and biosimilars work \\njust as well as the brand name drug or biological product and usually cost less. There are generic \\n\\nPage_138: \\n138 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n1.\\n2.\\n3.drug substitutes or biosimilar alternatives available for many brand name drugs and some \\nbiological products.\\nWhat is not on the Drug List?\\nThe plan does not cover all prescription drugs.\\nIn some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for \\nmore information about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter).\\nIn other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on the Drug List. In some \\ncases, you may be able to obtain a drug that is not on the drug list. For more information, \\nplease see Chapter 9.\\nSection 3.2 There are 5 “cost-sharing tiers” for drugs on the Drug List\\nEvery drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-  \\nsharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug:\\nTier 1 - Preferred Generic Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that are available at the lowest cost \\nshare for the plan.\\nTier 2 - Generic Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a cost to members that \\nis equal to or higher than the cost share for Tier 1 drugs.\\nTier 3 - Preferred Brand Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a lower cost to \\nmembers than Tier 4 drugs. Select Insulins are covered on this tier.\\nTier 4 - Non-Preferred Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a higher cost to \\nmembers than Tier 3 drugs.\\nTier 5 - Specialty Tier: Includes a select subset of high cost drugs, including injectables, \\ninfusions, and monoclonal antibodies. These drugs are the most expensive drugs on the \\nformulary. The cost share for these drugs will be higher than for Tier 4 drugs.\\nTo find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List. \\xa0The amount \\nyou pay for drugs in each cost-sharing tier is shown in Chapter 6 ( What you pay for your Part D \\nprescription drugs ).\\nSection 3.3 How can you find out if a specific drug is on the Drug List?\\nYou have 3 ways to find out:\\nCheck the most recent Drug List we provided electronically.\\nVisit the plan’s website (www.devoted.com). The Drug List on the website is always the \\nmost current.\\nCall Member Services to find out if a particular drug is on the plan’s Drug List or to ask for a \\ncopy of the list.\\n\\nPage_139: \\n139 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\nSECTION 4 There are restrictions on coverage for some drugs\\nSection 4.1 Why do some drugs have restrictions?\\nFor certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers them. A team \\nof doctors and pharmacists developed these rules to encourage you and your provider to use \\ndrugs in the most effective ways. To find out if any of these restrictions apply to a drug you take \\nor want to take, check the Drug List. If a safe, lower-cost drug will work just as well medically as a \\nhigher-cost drug, the plan’s rules are designed to encourage you and your provider to use that \\nlower-cost option. \\xa0\\nPlease note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once on our drug list. This is because \\nthe same drugs can differ based on the strength, amount, or form of the drug prescribed by your \\nhealth care provider, and different restrictions or cost sharing may apply to the different versions \\nof the drug (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg; one per day versus two per day; tablet versus \\nliquid).\\nSection 4.2 What kinds of restrictions?\\nThe sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain drugs. \\xa0\\nIf there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider will have to \\ntake extra steps in order for us to cover the drug.  Contact Member Services to learn what you \\nor your provider would need to do to get coverage for the drug. If you want us to waive the \\nrestriction for you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and ask us to make an \\nexception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9)\\nRestricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available\\nGenerally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. In most \\ncases, when  a generic version of a brand name drug is available, our network pharmacies will \\nprovide you the generic version instead of the brand name drug.  However, if your provider has \\ntold us the medical reason that the generic drug will not work for you OR has told us the medical \\nreason that neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that treat the same condition will \\nwork for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may be greater for \\nthe brand name drug than for the generic drug.)\\nGetting plan approval in advance\\nFor certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we will agree to \\ncover the drug for you. This is called “ prior authorization .” This is put in place to ensure \\n\\nPage_140: \\n140 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•medication safety and help guide appropriate use of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, \\nyour drug might not be covered by the plan.\\nTrying a different drug first\\nThis requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs before the \\nplan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition, \\nthe plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, the plan will then \\ncover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called “ step therapy .”\\nQuantity limits\\nFor certain drugs, we limit how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription. \\nFor example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we \\nmay limit coverage for your prescription to no more than one pill per day.\\nSECTION 5 What if one of your drugs is not covered in the way you’d like it \\nto be covered?\\nSection 5.1 There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way \\nyou’d like it to be covered\\nThere are situations where there is a prescription drug you are taking, or one that you and your \\nprovider think you should be taking, that is not on our formulary or is on our formulary with \\nrestrictions. For example:\\nThe drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug is covered but \\nthe brand name version you want to take is not covered.\\nThe drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for that drug, as \\nexplained in Section 4.\\nThe drug is covered, but it is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost-sharing more \\nexpensive than you think it should be. \\xa0\\nThere are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you’d like it to be \\ncovered. If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, go to Section 5.2 to \\nlearn what you can do.\\nIf your drug is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost more expensive than you think it \\nshould be, go to Section 5.3 to learn what you can do.\\n\\nPage_141: \\n141 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 5.2 What can you do if your drug is not on the Drug List or if the drug \\nis restricted in some way?\\nIf your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are options:\\nYou may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug.\\nYou can change to another drug.\\nYou can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions \\nfrom the drug.\\nYou may be able to get a temporary supply\\nUnder certain circumstances, the plan must provide a temporary supply of a drug that you are \\nalready taking. This temporary supply gives you time to talk with your provider about the change \\nin coverage and decide what to do.\\nTo be eligible for a temporary supply, the drug you have been taking must no longer be on the \\nplan’s Drug List  OR is now restricted in some way .\\nIf you are a new member,  we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the first 90 \\ndays  of your membership in the plan .\\nIf you were in the plan last year, we will cover a temporary supply of your drug during the \\nfirst 90 days of the calendar year.\\nThis temporary supply will be for a maximum of 30 days. If your prescription is written for \\nfewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a maximum of 30 days of \\nmedication. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the \\nlong-term care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent \\nwaste.)\\nFor those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days  and reside in a \\nlong-term care facility and need a supply right away:\\nWe will cover one 31-day emergency supply of a particular drug, or less if your \\nprescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary \\nsupply.\\nFor current members who have a change in level of care such as being discharged from \\na hospital or transferring out of long-term care facility, you can ask for a temporary \\nsupply.\\nTo ask for a temporary supply, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on \\nthe back cover of this booklet). \\xa0\\nDuring the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk \\nwith your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You \\ncan either switch to a different drug covered by the plan or ask the plan to make an \\nexception for you and cover your current drug. The sections below tell you more about \\nthese options.\\nFor questions about a temporary supply, call Member Services.\\n\\nPage_142: \\n142 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\nDuring the time when you are using a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your \\nprovider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You have two options: \\xa0\\n1) You can change to another drug\\nTalk with your provider about whether there is a different drug covered by the plan that may work \\njust as well for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the \\nsame medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for \\nyou.\\xa0\\n2) You can ask for an exception\\nYou and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug in the way you \\nwould like it covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us \\nfor an exception, your provider can help you request an exception. For example, you can ask the \\nplan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan’s Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make \\nan exception and cover the drug without restrictions.\\nIf you are a current member and a drug you are taking will be removed from the formulary or \\nrestricted in some way for next year, we will tell you about any change prior to the new year. You \\ncan ask for an exception before next year and we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we \\nreceive your request (or your prescriber’s supporting statement). If we approve your request, we \\nwill authorize the coverage before the change takes effect.\\nIf you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells you what to do . \\nIt explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your \\nrequest is handled promptly and fairly.\\nSection 5.3 What can you do if your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is \\ntoo high?\\nIf your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, here are things you can do:\\nYou can change to another drug\\nIf your drug is in a cost-sharing tier you think is too high, talk to your provider.

This list can help \\nyour provider find a covered drug that might work for you.\\nYou can ask for an exception\\nYou and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception in the cost-sharing tier for the drug \\nso that you pay less for it. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking \\nus for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule.\\n\\nPage_143: \\n143 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells what to do .

We do not lower the \\ncost-sharing amount for drugs in this tier.\\nSECTION 6 What if your coverage changes for one of your drugs?\\nSection 6.1 The Drug List can change during the year\\nMost of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, \\nduring the year, the plan can make some changes to the Drug List. For example, the plan might:\\nAdd or remove drugs from the Drug List .\\xa0\\nMove a drug to a higher or lower cost-sharing tier .\\nAdd or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug.\\nReplace a brand name drug with a generic drug. \\xa0\\nWe must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan’s Drug List.\\nSection 6.2 What happens if coverage changes for a drug you are taking?\\nInformation on changes to drug coverage\\nWhen changes to the Drug List occur, we post information on our website about those changes. \\nWe also update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis. Below we point out the times \\nthat you would get direct notice if changes are made to a drug that you are taking.\\nChanges to your drug coverage that affect you during the current plan year\\nA new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we change the cost-  \\nsharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both)\\nWe may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we are replacing it \\nwith a newly approved generic version of the same drug. The generic drug will appear \\non the same or lower cost-sharing tier and with the same or fewer restrictions. We \\nmay decide to keep the brand name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to \\na higher cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions or both when the new generic is \\nadded.\\nWe may not tell you in advance before we make that change—even if you are currently \\ntaking the brand name drug. If you are taking the brand name drug at the time we \\n\\nPage_144: \\n144 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•make the change, we will provide you with information about the specific change(s). \\nThis will also include information on the steps you may take to request an exception \\nto cover the brand name drug. You may not get this notice before we make the \\nchange.\\nYou or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the \\nbrand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter \\n9.\\nUnsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from the market\\nSometimes a drug may be deemed unsafe or taken off the market for another reason. \\nIf this happens, we may immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. If you are \\ntaking that drug, we will tell you right away. \\xa0\\nYour prescriber will also know about this change, and can work with you to find \\nanother drug for your condition.\\nOther changes to drugs on the Drug List\\nWe may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs you are \\ntaking. For example, we might add a generic drug that is not new to the market to \\nreplace a brand name drug on the Drug List or change the cost-sharing tier or add new \\nrestrictions to the brand name drug or both. We also might make changes based on \\nFDA boxed warnings or new clinical guidelines recognized by Medicare. \\xa0\\nFor these changes, we must give you at least 30 days’ advance notice of the change or \\ngive you notice of the change and a 30 -day refill of the drug you are taking at a \\nnetwork pharmacy.\\nAfter you receive notice of the change, you should work with your prescriber to switch \\nto a different drug that we cover or to satisfy any new restrictions on the drug you are \\ntaking.\\xa0\\nYou or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the \\ndrug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9.\\nChanges to the Drug List that do not affect you during this plan year \\xa0\\nWe may make certain changes to the Drug List that are not described above. In these cases, the \\nchange will not apply to you if you are taking the drug when the change is made; however, these \\nchanges will likely affect you starting January 1 of the next plan year if you stay in the same plan. \\xa0\\nIn general, changes that will not affect you during the current plan year are:\\nWe move your drug into a higher cost-sharing tier.\\nWe put a new restriction on the use of your drug.\\nWe remove your drug from the Drug List.\\nIf any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (except for market withdrawal, a generic \\ndrug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections above), then the change \\nwon’t affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cost until January 1 of the next year. \\nUntil that date, you probably won’t see any increase in your payments or any added restrictions \\nto your use of the drug. \\xa0\\n\\nPage_145: \\n145 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•We will not tell you about these types of changes directly during the current plan year. You will \\nneed to check the Drug List for the next plan year (when the list is available during the open \\nenrollment period) to see if there are any changes to the drugs you are taking that will impact you \\nduring the next plan year.\\nSECTION 7 What types of drugs are not covered by the plan?\\nSection 7.1 Types of drugs we do not cover\\nThis section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are “excluded.” This means Medicare does \\nnot pay for these drugs. \\xa0If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yourself \\n(except for certain excluded drugs covered under our enhanced drug coverage). If you appeal and \\nthe requested drug is found not to be excluded under Part D, we will pay for or cover it. (For \\ninformation about appealing a decision, go to Chapter 9.)\\nHere are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover under Part D:\\nOur plan’s Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare \\nPart A or Part B. \\xa0\\nOur plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States or its territories.\\nOur plan usually cannot cover off-label use. “Off-label use” is any use of the drug other than \\nthose indicated on a drug’s label as approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\\nCoverage for “off-label use” is allowed only when the use is supported by certain \\nreferences, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the \\nDRUGDEX Information System.\\nIn addition, by law, the following categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare drug plans: \\n(Our plan covers certain drugs listed below through our enhanced drug coverage. More \\ninformation is provided below.)\\nNon-prescription drugs (also called over-the-counter drugs)\\nDrugs used to promote fertility\\nDrugs used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms\\nDrugs used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth\\nPrescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride \\npreparations\\nDrugs used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction\\nDrugs used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain\\nOutpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or \\nmonitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer as a condition of sale\\n\\nPage_146: \\n146 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\nWe offer additional coverage of some prescription drugs (enhanced drug coverage) not normally \\ncovered in a Medicare prescription drug plan. Your plan offers additional benefits for some \\nvitamins and erectile dysfunction drugs (ED). These medications will be covered at a Tier 2 cost \\nshare throughout the entire plan year. The Tier 2 cost share will remain the same through all \\nbenefit stages. Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg/ml (B12 injections), folic acid 1 mg, vitamin d 1.25 mg \\n(50000 ut), Sildenafil (generic Viagra), \\xa0and Tadalafil (generic Cialis) are covered as Tier 2 \\nmedications. You are covered up to 6 pills per month of either Sildenafil or Tadalafil or \\na\\xa0combination of the two medications, not to exceed 6 pills per month with a maximum of 72 \\npills\\xa0per year. The amount you pay for these drugs does not count towards qualifying you for the \\nCatastrophic Coverage Stage. (The Catastrophic Coverage Stage is described in Chapter 6, \\nSection 7 of this document.)\\nIn addition, if you are receiving “Extra Help” to pay for your prescriptions, the “Extra Help” \\nprogram will not pay for the drugs not normally covered. However, if you have drug coverage \\nthrough Medicaid, your state Medicaid program may cover some prescription drugs not normally \\ncovered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your state Medicaid program to determine what \\ndrug coverage may be available to you. (You can find phone numbers and contact information for \\nMedicaid in Chapter \\xa02, Section 6.)\\nSECTION 8 Filling a prescription\\nSection 8.1 Provide your membership information\\nTo fill your prescription, provide your plan membership information, which can be found on your \\nmembership card, at the network pharmacy you choose. The network pharmacy will \\nautomatically bill the plan for our share of your drug cost. You will need to pay the pharmacy \\nyour  share of the cost when you pick up your prescription. \\xa0\\nSection 8.2 What if you don’t have your membership information with you?\\nIf you don’t have your plan membership information with you when you fill your prescription, you \\nor the pharmacy can call the plan to get the necessary information.\\nIf the pharmacy is not able to get the necessary information, you may have to pay the full cost \\nof the prescription when you pick it up . (You can then ask us to reimburse you  for our share. \\nSee Chapter 7, Section 2 for information about how to ask the plan for reimbursement.)\\nSECTION 9 Part D drug coverage in special situations\\n\\nPage_147: \\n147 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\nSection 9.1 What if you’re in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility for a stay \\nthat is covered by the plan?\\nIf you are admitted to a hospital or to a skilled nursing facility for a stay covered by the plan, we \\nwill generally cover the cost of your prescription drugs during your stay. Once you leave the \\nhospital or skilled nursing facility, the plan will cover your prescription drugs as long as the drugs \\nmeet all of our rules for coverage described in this Chapter.\\nSection 9.2 What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility?\\nUsually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy, or uses a \\npharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of a LTC facility, you \\nmay get your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy or the one it uses, as long as it is \\npart of our network.\\nCheck your Devoted Health Provider &  Pharmacy Directory  to find out if your LTC facility’s \\npharmacy or the one that it uses is part of our network. If it isn’t, or if you need more information \\nor assistance, please contact Member Services. If you are in an LTC facility, we must ensure that \\nyou are able to routinely receive your Part D benefits through our network of LTC pharmacies.\\nWhat if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a drug that is not on our \\nDrug List or is restricted in some way?\\nPlease refer to Section 5.2 about a temporary or emergency supply.\\nSection 9.3 What if you’re also getting drug coverage from an employer or \\nretiree group plan?\\nIf you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s) employer \\nor retiree group please contact that group’s benefits administrator. He or she can help you \\ndetermine how your current prescription drug coverage will work with our plan.\\nIn general, if you have employee or retiree group coverage, the drug coverage you get from us will \\nbe secondary  to your group coverage. That means your group coverage would pay first. \\xa0\\nSpecial note about ‘creditable coverage’:\\nEach year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your prescription \\ndrug coverage for the next calendar year is “creditable.” \\xa0\\n\\nPage_148: \\n148 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•If the coverage from the group plan is “ creditable ,” it means that the plan has drug coverage that \\nis expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug \\ncoverage.\\nKeep this notice about creditable coverage , because you may need them later. If you enroll in a \\nMedicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need these notices to show that you \\nhave maintained creditable coverage. If you didn’t get the creditable coverage notice, request a \\ncopy from your employer or retiree plan’s benefits administrator or the employer or union.\\nSection 9.4 What if you’re in Medicare-certified hospice?\\nHospice and our plan do not cover the same drug at the same time. If you are enrolled in \\nMedicare hospice and require certain drugs (e.g., anti-nausea, laxative, pain medication or \\nantianxiety drugs) that are not covered by your hospice because it is unrelated to your terminal \\nillness and related conditions, our plan must receive notification from either the prescriber or \\nyour hospice provider that the drug is unrelated before our plan can cover the drug. To prevent \\ndelays in receiving these drugs that should be covered by our plan, ask your hospice provider or \\nprescriber to provide notification before your prescription is filled. \\xa0\\nIn the event you either revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice, our plan \\nshould cover your drugs as explained in this document. To prevent any delays at a pharmacy \\nwhen your Medicare hospice benefit ends, bring documentation to the pharmacy to verify your \\nrevocation or discharge.\\nSECTION 10 Programs on drug safety and managing medications\\nSection 10.1 Programs to help members use drugs safely\\nWe conduct drug use reviews for our members to help make sure that they are getting safe and \\nappropriate care.\\nWe do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. \\nDuring these reviews, we look for potential problems such as:\\nPossible medication errors\\nDrugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same \\ncondition\\nDrugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender\\nCertain combinations of drugs that could harm you if taken at the same time\\nPrescriptions for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to \\xa0\\nPossible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking \\xa0\\n\\nPage_149: \\n149 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Unsafe amounts of opioid pain medications\\nIf we see a possible problem in your use of medications, we will work with your provider to \\ncorrect the problem.\\nSection 10.2 Drug Management Program (DMP) to help members safely use \\ntheir opioid medications\\nWe have a program that helps make sure members safely use prescription opioids and other \\nfrequently abused medications. This program is called a Drug Management Program (DMP). If you \\nuse opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies, or if you had a recent \\nopioid overdose, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use of opioid medications is \\nappropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of \\nprescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get \\nthose medications. If we place you in our DMP, the limitations may be:\\nRequiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a \\ncertain pharmacy(ies)\\nRequiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a \\ncertain doctor(s)\\nLimiting the amount of opioid or benzodiazepine medications we will cover for you\\nIf we plan on limiting how you may get these medications or how much you can get, we will send \\nyou a letter in advance. The letter will explain the limitations we think should apply to you. You \\nwill have an opportunity to tell us which doctors or pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any \\nother information you think is important for us to know. After you’ve had the opportunity to \\nrespond, if we decide to limit your coverage for these medications, we will send you another \\nletter confirming the limitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our \\ndetermination or with the limitation, you and your prescriber have the right to appeal. If you \\nappeal, we will review your case and give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of your \\nrequest related to the limitations that apply to your access to medications, we will automatically \\nsend your case to an independent reviewer outside of our plan. See Chapter 9 for information \\nabout how to ask for an appeal.\\nYou will not be placed in our DMP if you have certain medical conditions, such as active cancer-  \\nrelated pain or sickle cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative, or end-of-life care, or live \\nin a long-term care facility.\\n\\nPage_150: \\n150 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 5 : Using the plan’s coverage for Part D prescription drugs\\nSection 10.3 Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program to help \\nmembers manage their medications\\nWe have a program that can help our members with complex health needs. Our program is called \\na Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program. This program is voluntary and free. A team of \\npharmacists and doctors developed the program for us to help make sure that our members get \\nthe most benefit from the drugs they take.\\nSome members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high drug costs, \\nor are in a DMP to help members use their opioids safely, may be able to get services through an \\nMTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of \\nall your medications. During the review, you can talk about your medications, your costs, and any \\nproblems or questions you have about your prescription and over-the-counter medications. \\nYou’ll get a written summary which has a recommended to-do list that includes steps you should \\ntake to get the best results from your medications. You’ll also get a medication list that will \\ninclude all the medications you’re taking, how much you take, and when and why you take them. \\nIn addition, members in the MTM program will receive information on the safe disposal of \\nprescription medications that are controlled substances. \\xa0\\nIt’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about your recommended to-do list and medication list. \\nBring the summary with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your doctors, pharmacists, and \\nother health care providers. Also, keep your medication list up to date and with you (for example, \\nwith your ID) in case you go to the hospital or emergency room.\\nIf we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and \\nsend you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us and we will withdraw you. \\nIf you have any questions about this program, please contact Member Services.\\n\\nPage_151: \\nCHAPTER 6 : \\nWhat you pay for your Part D prescription \\ndrugs\\n\\nPage_152: \\n152 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•Are you currently getting help to pay for your drugs?\\nIf you are in a program that helps pay for your drugs, some information in this Evidence of \\nCoverage  about the costs for Part D prescription drugs may not apply to you.

If you don’t have this insert, please call Member Services and \\nask for the “LIS Rider.”\\nSECTION 1 Introduction\\nSection 1.1 Use this chapter together with other materials that explain your \\ndrug coverage\\nThis chapter focuses on what you pay for Part D prescription drugs. To keep things simple, we \\nuse “drug” in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained in Chapter 5, not all \\ndrugs are Part D drugs – some drugs are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B and other drugs \\nare excluded from Medicare coverage by law. \\xa0\\nTo understand the payment information, you need to know what drugs are covered, where to fill \\nyour prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered drugs. Chapter 5, \\nSections 1 through 4 explain these rules.\\nSection 1.2 Types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for covered drugs\\nThere are different types of out-of-pocket costs for Part D drugs. The amount that you pay for a \\ndrug is called “cost sharing” and there are three ways you may be asked to pay. \\xa0\\nThe “deductible”  is the amount you pay for drugs before our plan begins to pay its share.\\n“Copayment”  is a fixed amount you pay each time you fill a prescription.\\n“Coinsurance”  is a percentage of the total cost you pay each time you fill a prescription.\\nSection 1.3 How Medicare calculates your out-of-pocket costs\\nMedicare has rules about what counts and what does not count toward your out-of-pocket costs. \\nHere are the rules we must follow to keep track of your out-of-pocket costs.\\n\\nPage_153: \\n153 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•These payments are included  in your out-of-pocket costs\\nYour out-of-pocket costs include  the payments listed below (as long as they are for Part D \\ncovered drugs and you followed the rules for drug coverage that are explained in Chapter 5):\\nThe amount you pay for drugs when you are in any of the following drug payment stages:\\nThe Deductible Stage\\nThe Initial Coverage Stage\\nThe Coverage Gap Stage\\nAny payments you made during this calendar year as a member of a different Medicare \\nprescription drug plan before you joined our plan.\\nIt matters who pays:\\nIf you make these payments yourself , they are included in your out-of-pocket costs.\\nThese payments are also included  if they are made on your behalf by certain other \\nindividuals or organizations. This includes payments for your drugs made by a friend or \\nrelative, by most charities, by AIDS drug assistance programs, or by the Indian Health \\nService. Payments made by Medicare’s “Extra Help” Program are also included.\\nSome payments made by the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program are included. The \\namount the manufacturer pays for your brand name drugs is included. But the amount the \\nplan pays for your generic drugs is not included.\\nMoving on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage:\\nWhen you (or those paying on your behalf) have spent a total of $7,400 in out-of-pocket costs \\nwithin the calendar year, you will move from the Coverage Gap Stage to the Catastrophic \\nCoverage Stage.\\nThese payments are not included  in your out-of-pocket costs\\nYour out-of-pocket costs do not include  any of these types of payments:\\nYour monthly premium.\\nDrugs you buy outside the United States and its territories.\\nDrugs that are not covered by our plan.\\nDrugs you get at an out-of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan’s requirements for \\nout-of-network coverage.\\nPrescription drugs covered by Part A or Part B.\\nPayments you make toward drugs covered under our additional coverage but not normally \\ncovered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.\\nPayments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare \\nPrescription Drug Plan.\\nPayments made by the plan for your brand or generic drugs while in the Coverage Gap.\\nPayments for your drugs that are made by group health plans including employer health \\nplans.\\n\\nPage_154: \\n154 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and government-funded \\nhealth programs such as TRICARE and the Veterans Affairs.\\nPayments for your drugs made by a third-party with a legal obligation to pay for \\nprescription costs (for example, Workers’ Compensation).\\nReminder:  If any other organization such as the ones listed above pays part or all of your out-of-  \\npocket costs for drugs, you are required to tell our plan by calling Member Services.\\nHow can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total?\\nWe will help you . The Part D EOB report you receive includes the current amount of your \\nout-of-pocket costs. When this amount reaches $7,400, this report will tell you that you \\nhave left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.\\nMake sure we have the information we need .

How much you pay depends on which stage you are in when you get a prescription filled \\nor refilled. Details of each stage are in Sections 4 through 7 of this chapter. The stages are:\\nStage 1: Yearly Deductible Stage\\nStage 2: Initial Coverage Stage\\nStage 3: Coverage Gap Stage\\nStage 4: Catastrophic Coverage Stage\\nImportant Message About What You Pay for Insulin  - You won’t pay more than $0 for a one-  \\nmonth supply of each insulin product covered by our plan, no matter what cost-sharing tier it’s \\non, even if you haven’t paid your deductible.

This way, we can tell you when \\nyou have moved from one drug payment stage to the next. In particular, there are two types of \\ncosts we keep track of:\\nWe keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your “ out-of-pocket ” cost.\\nWe keep track of your “ total drug costs .” This is the amount you pay out-of-pocket or \\nothers pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan. \\xa0\\nIf you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous month we \\nwill send you a Part D  Explanation of Benefits (“Part D EOB”). The Part D EOB includes: \\xa0\\nInformation for that month . This report gives the payment details about the prescriptions \\nyou have filled during the previous month. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, \\nand what you and others on your behalf paid.\\nTotals for the year since January 1. This is called “year-to-date” information. It shows the \\ntotal drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year began. \\xa0\\nDrug price information. This information will display the total drug price, and information \\nabout increases in price from first fill for each prescription claim of the same quantity. \\xa0\\nAvailable lower cost alternative prescriptions. This will include information about other \\navailable drugs with lower cost sharing for each prescription claim.\\nSection 3.2 Help us keep our information about your drug payments up to \\ndate\\nTo keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records we get \\nfrom pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct and up to date:\\nShow your membership card every time you get a prescription filled.  This helps us make \\nsure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and what you are paying.\\nMake sure we have the information we need.  There are times you may pay for the entire \\ncost of a prescription drug. In these cases, we will not automatically get the information we \\nneed to keep \\xa0track of your out-of-pocket costs. To help us keep track of your out-of-pocket \\ncosts, give us copies of these receipts. Here are examples of when you should give us copies \\nof your drug receipts: \\xa0\\nWhen you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a \\ndiscount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit. \\xa0\\nWhen you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer \\npatient assistance program.\\n\\nPage_156: \\n156 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out-of-network pharmacies or other \\ntimes you have paid the full price for a covered drug under special circumstances.\\nIf you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share of the cost. \\nFor instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section 2.\\nSend us information about the payments others have made for you.  Payments made by \\ncertain other individuals and organizations also count toward your out-of-pocket costs. For \\nexample, payments made by an AIDS drug assistance program (ADAP), the Indian Health \\nService, and most charities count toward your out-of-pocket costs. Keep a record of these \\npayments and send them to us so we can track your costs. \\xa0\\nCheck the written report we send you.  When you receive the Part D EOB look it over to be \\nsure the information is complete and correct. If you think something is missing or you have \\nany questions, please call us at Member Services. Be sure to keep these reports. \\xa0\\nSECTION 4 During the Deductible Stage, you pay the full cost of your Tier \\n3 - 5 drugs\\nThe Deductible Stage is the first payment stage for your drug coverage. You will pay a yearly \\ndeductible of $505 on Tier 3 - 5 drugs. You must pay the full cost of your Tier 3 - 5 drugs  until \\nyou reach the plan’s deductible amount. For all other drugs, you will not have to pay any \\ndeductible and will start receiving coverage immediately. The “full cost”  is usually lower than \\nthe normal full price of the drug, since our plan has negotiated lower costs for most drugs at \\nnetwork pharmacies.\\nOnce you have paid $505 for your Tier 3 - 5 drugs, you leave the Deductible Stage and move on to \\nthe Initial Coverage Stage. \\xa0\\nThere is no deductible for Devoted PRIME (HMO) for select insulins. During the Deductible Stage, \\nyour out-of-pocket costs for these select insulins will be $0 for a one-month supply from a retail \\npharmacy. To find out which drugs are select insulins, review the most recent Drug List we \\nprovided electronically. You can identify Select Insulins by looking in your plan Formulary (drug \\nlist). Select Insulins are indicated with an \"SI\" label. If you have questions about the Drug List, \\nyou can also call Member Services (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back \\ncover of this booklet).\\n\\nPage_157: \\n157 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•SECTION 5 During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of \\nyour drug costs and you pay your share\\nSection 5.1 What you pay for a drug depends on the drug and where you fill \\nyour prescription\\nDuring the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered prescription \\ndrugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount). Your share of the cost \\nwill vary depending on the drug and where you fill your prescription.\\nThe plan has 5 cost-sharing tiers\\nEvery drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-  \\nsharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug:\\nTier 1 - Preferred Generic Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that are available at the lowest cost \\nshare for the plan.\\nTier 2 - Generic Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a cost to members that \\nis equal to or higher than the cost share for Tier 1 drugs.\\nTier 3 - Preferred Brand Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a lower cost to \\nmembers than Tier 4 drugs.\\nTier 4 - Non-Preferred Drugs: Generic or brand drugs that the plan offers at a higher cost to \\nmembers than Tier 3 drugs.\\nTier 5 - Specialty Tier: Includes a select subset of high cost drugs, including injectables, \\ninfusions, and monoclonal antibodies. These drugs are the most expensive drugs on the \\nformulary. The cost share for these drugs will be higher than for Tier 4 drugs.\\nTo find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List. \\xa0\\nYour pharmacy choices\\nHow much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from:\\nA network retail pharmacy\\nA pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network.

(This is sometimes \\ncalled the “administration” of the vaccine.)\\nYour costs for a Part D vaccination depend on three things:\\n2. The type of vaccine  (what you are being vaccinated for).\\nSome vaccines are considered medical benefits. (See the Medical Benefits Chart (what is \\ncovered and what you pay) in Chapter 4).\\nOther vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan’s \\nList of Covered Drugs (Formulary).\\n2. Where you get the vaccine.\\nThe vaccine itself may be dispensed by a pharmacy or provided by the doctor’s office.\\n3. Who gives you the vaccine.\\nA pharmacist may give the vaccine in the pharmacy or another provider may give it in the \\ndoctor’s office.\\nWhat you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the \\ncircumstances and what Drug Stage you are in. \\xa0\\n\\nPage_164: \\n164 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 6 : What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Sometimes when you get a vaccination, you have to pay for the entire cost for both the \\nvaccine itself and the cost for the provider to give you the vaccine. You can ask our plan to \\npay you back for our share of the cost. \\xa0\\nOther times, when you get a vaccination, you will pay only your share of the cost under your \\nPart D benefit. \\xa0\\nBelow are three examples of ways you might get a Part D vaccine.\\nSituation 1:  \\xa0You get your vaccination at the network pharmacy. (Whether you have this choice \\ndepends on where you live. Some states do not allow pharmacies to give vaccines.)\\nYou will pay the pharmacy your coinsurance OR copayment for the vaccine itself which \\nincludes the cost of giving you the vaccine. \\xa0\\nOur plan will pay the remainder of the costs.\\nSituation 2:  You get the Part D vaccination at your doctor’s office. \\xa0\\nWhen you get the vaccine, you will pay for the entire cost of the vaccine itself and the cost \\nfor the provider to give it to you. \\xa0\\nYou can then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures that are \\ndescribed in Chapter 7.\\nYou will be reimbursed the amount you paid less your normal coinsurance OR copayment \\nfor the vaccine (including administration).\\nSituation 3:  You buy the Part D vaccine itself at your pharmacy, and then take it to your doctor’s \\noffice where they give you the vaccine.\\nYou will have to pay the pharmacy your coinsurance OR copayment for the vaccine itself. \\xa0\\nWhen your doctor gives you the vaccine, you will pay the entire cost for this service. You \\ncan then ask our plan to pay our share of the cost by using the procedures described in \\nChapter 7.\\nYou will be reimbursed the amount charged by the doctor for administering the vaccine.\\n\\nPage_165: \\nCHAPTER 7 : \\nAsking us to pay our share of a bill you have \\nreceived for covered medical services or drugs\\n\\nPage_166: \\n166 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 7 : Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services \\nor drugs\\n•\\n•SECTION 1 Situations in which you should ask us to pay our share of the \\ncost of your covered services or drugs\\nSometimes when you get medical care or a prescription drug, you may need to pay the full cost. \\nOther times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of \\nthe plan. In these cases, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called \\n“reimbursing” you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you’ve paid more than \\nyour share of the cost for medical services or drugs that are covered by our plan. There may be \\ndeadlines that you must meet to get paid back. Please see Section 2 of this chapter.\\nThere may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you \\nhave received or possibly for more than your share of cost sharing as discussed in the document. \\nFirst try to resolve the bill with the provider. If that does not work, send the bill to us instead of \\npaying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide \\nthey should be covered, we will pay the provider directly. If we decide not to pay it, we will notify \\nthe provider. You should never pay more than plan-allowed cost sharing. If this provider is \\ncontracted you still have the right to treatment. \\xa0\\nHere are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay \\na bill you have received:\\n1. When you’ve received emergency or urgently needed medical care from a provider who is \\nnot in our plan’s network\\nYou can receive emergency or urgently needed services from any provider, whether or not the \\nprovider is a part of our network. In these cases, \\xa0\\nYou are only responsible for paying your share of the cost for emergency or urgently needed \\nservices. Emergency providers are legally required to provide emergency care. If you \\naccidentally pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, ask us to pay \\nyou back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any \\npayments you have made.\\nYou may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. \\nSend us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. \\xa0\\nIf the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. \\xa0\\nIf you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will \\ndetermine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost.\\n2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay\\nNetwork providers should always bill the plan directly and ask you only for your share of the cost. \\nBut sometimes they make mistakes and ask you to pay more than your share. \\xa0\\n\\nPage_167: \\n167 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 7 : Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services \\nor drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•You only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get covered services. We do not \\nallow providers to add additional separate charges, called “balance billing.” This protection \\n(that you never pay more than your cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the \\nprovider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we \\ndon’t pay certain provider charges. \\xa0\\nWhenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, \\nsend us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. \\xa0\\nIf you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, \\nsend us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay \\nyou back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the \\nplan.\\n3. If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan \\xa0\\nSometimes a person’s enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (This means that the first day of their \\nenrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) \\xa0\\nIf you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out-of-pocket for any of your covered \\nservices or drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncosts. You will need to submit paperwork such as receipts and bills for us to handle the \\nreimbursement.\\n4. When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled\\nIf you go to an out-of-network pharmacy, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim \\ndirectly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. \\xa0\\nSave your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncost. Remember that we only cover out of network pharmacies in limited circumstances. See \\nChapter 5, Section 2.5 for a discussion of these circumstances.\\n5. When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don’t have your plan \\nmembership card with you\\nIf you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy to call the \\nplan or to look up your plan enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy cannot get the \\nenrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the \\nprescription yourself.\\nSave your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the \\ncost.\\n6. When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations \\xa0\\nYou may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for \\nsome reason. \\xa0\\n\\nPage_168: \\n168 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 7 : Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services \\nor drugs\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•For example, the drug may not be on the plan’s List of Covered Drugs (Formulary) ; or it \\ncould have a requirement or restriction that you didn’t know about or don’t think should \\napply to you. If you decide to get the drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost \\nfor it.\\xa0\\nSave your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some \\nsituations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in order to pay you back \\nfor our share of the cost.\\nAll of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your \\nrequest for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 9 of this document has information \\nabout how to make an appeal.\\nSECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have \\nreceived\\nYou may request us to pay you back by sending us a request in writing. If you send a request in \\nwriting, send your bill and documentation of any payment you have made. It’s a good idea to \\nmake a copy of your bill and receipts for your records. You must submit your claim to us within \\n365 days of the date you received the service, item, or drug.\\nTo make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you can fill out \\nour claim form to make your request for payment. \\xa0\\nYou don’t have to use the form, but it will help us process the information faster. The \\ninformation required to make a decision are your name, address, proof of payment, \\nexplanation of service or item received, date of service, and the name of the provider that \\ndelivered the service/item .\\nEither download a copy of the form from our website ( www.devoted.com ) or call Member \\nServices and ask for the form.\\nYou may also submit your request for Medical Services electronically through the following \\nwebsite https://my.devoted.com/reimbursement\\nMail your request for payment together with any bills or paid receipts to us at this address:\\nRequest for payment of Medical Services: \\xa0 \\nDevoted Health  \\nATTN: Member Reimbursements  \\nP.O.

Otherwise, we will consider your request and make a coverage decision. \\xa0\\nIf we decide that the medical care or drug is covered and you followed all the rules, we will \\npay for our share of the cost. If you have already paid for the service or drug, we will mail \\nyour reimbursement of our share of the cost to you. If you have not paid for the service or \\ndrug yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider. \\xa0\\nIf we decide that the medical care or drug is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, \\nwe will not pay for our share of the cost. We will send you a letter explaining the reasons \\nwhy we are not sending the payment and your rights to appeal that decision.\\nSection 3.2 If we tell you that we will not pay for all or part of the medical care \\nor drug, you can make an appeal\\nIf you think we have made a mistake in turning down your request for payment or the amount we \\nare paying, you can make an appeal.

Each process has a set of rules, \\nprocedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.\\nThe guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you should do.\\nSection 1.2 What about the legal terms?\\nThere are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this \\nchapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To \\nmake things easier, this chapter: \\xa0\\nUses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says \\n“making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage decision” rather than \\n“organization determination,” or “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination,” and \\n“independent review organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.” \\xa0\\nIt also uses abbreviations as little as possible. \\xa0\\nHowever, it can be helpful – and sometimes quite important – for you to know the correct legal \\nterms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more accurately to get the right \\nhelp or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal \\nterms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations.\\nSECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized assistance\\nWe are always available to help you.

The guide that follows will help.\\nIs your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage?\\nThis includes problems about whether medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the \\nway they are covered, and problems related to payment for medical care or prescription drugs.\\nYes.\\nGo on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, “A guide to the basics of coverage \\ndecisions and appeals.”\\nNo.\\nSkip ahead to  Section 10 at the end of this chapter:  “How to make a complaint about quality of \\ncare, waiting times, customer service or other concerns.”\\nCOVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS\\n\\nPage_181: \\n181 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\nSECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals\\nSection 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture\\nCoverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and coverage for \\nmedical services and prescription drugs, including payment. This is the process you use for \\nissues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered.\\nAsking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services\\nA coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount \\nwe will pay for your medical services or drugs. For example, your plan network doctor makes a \\n(favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if \\nyour network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us \\nand ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical \\nservice or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to \\nknow if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage \\ndecision for you. In limited circumstances a request for a coverage decision will be dismissed, \\nwhich means we won’t review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include \\nif the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf but isn’t legally \\nauthorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a \\ncoverage decision, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to \\nask for a review of the dismissal.\\nWe are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how \\nmuch we pay. In some cases, we might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer \\ncovered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an \\nappeal.\\xa0\\nMaking an appeal\\nIf we make a coverage decision, whether before or after a service is received, and you are not \\nsatisfied, you can “appeal” the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and \\nchange a coverage decision we have made. Under certain circumstances, which we discuss later, \\nyou can request an expedited or “fast appeal” of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by \\ndifferent reviewers than those who made the original decision.\\nWhen you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 appeal. In this appeal, we \\nreview the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly following the rules. \\nWhen we have completed the review, we give you our decision. In limited circumstances a request \\nfor a Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means we won’t review the request. Examples of \\nwhen a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the \\nrequest on your behalf but isn’t legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be \\n\\nPage_182: \\n182 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a Level 1 appeal, we will send a notice explaining why the \\nrequest was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. \\xa0\\nIf we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, you can go on to a \\nLevel 2 appeal. The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review organization that is \\nnot connected to us. (Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs will be automatically sent to \\nthe independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal - you do not need to do anything. For \\nPart D drug appeals, if we say no to all or part of your appeal you will need to ask for a Level 2 \\nappeal. Part D appeals are discussed further in Section 6 of this chapter.) If you are not satisfied \\nwith the decision at the Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of \\nappeal (Section 9 in this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes). \\xa0\\nSection 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or \\nmaking an appeal\\nHere are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision:\\nYou can call us at Member Services .\\xa0\\nYou can get free help  from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.\\nYour doctor can make a request for you. If your doctor helps with an appeal past Level 2, \\nthey will need to be appointed as your representative. Please call Member Services and ask \\nfor the “Appointment of Representative” form. (The form is also available on Medicare’s \\nwebsite at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf  or on \\nour website at www.devoted.com/plan-documents/member-forms/ .)\\nFor medical care or Part B prescription drugs, your doctor can request a coverage \\ndecision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. \\xa0If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be \\nautomatically forwarded to Level 2. \\xa0\\nFor Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage \\ndecision or a Level 1 appeal on your behalf. If your Level 1 appeal is denied your doctor \\nor prescriber can request a Level 2 appeal.\\nYou can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person \\nto act for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal.\\nIf you want a friend, relative, or other person to be your representative, call Member \\nServices and ask for the “Appointment of Representative” form.

You can also \\nget help or information from government organizations such as your SHIP.\\nSECTION 5 Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make \\nan appeal of a coverage decision\\nSection 5.1 This section tells what to do if you have problems getting \\ncoverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our \\nshare of the cost of your care\\nThis section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in \\nChapter 4 of this document: Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) . To keep \\nthings simple, we generally refer to “medical care coverage” or “medical care” which includes \\nmedical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, different \\nrules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how the \\nrules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services.\\n\\nPage_184: \\n184 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations:\\n1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by \\nour plan.  Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2.\\n2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give \\nyou, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan.  Ask for a coverage decision. Section \\n5.2.\\n3. You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have \\nsaid we will not pay for this care.  Make an appeal. Section 5.3.\\n4. You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, \\nand you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section 5.3\\n5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we \\npreviously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this \\ncare could harm your health. Make an appeal. Section 5.5\\nNote:  If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled \\nnursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services , \\nyou need to read Sections 7 and 8 of this Chapter. Special rules apply to these types of care. \\xa0\\nSection 5.2 Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision\\nLegal Terms\\nWhen a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an “organization \\ndetermination.”  \\n \\nA “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited determination.”\\nStep 1:  Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage decision.”\\nA “standard coverage decision” is usually made within 14 days  or 72 hours for Part B drugs. A \\n“fast coverage decision” is generally made within 72 hours, for medical services, 24 hours for \\nPart B drugs. In order to get a fast coverage  decision, you must meet two requirements:\\nYou may only ask  for coverage for medical care  you have not yet received .\\xa0\\nYou can get a fast coverage decision only  if using the standard deadlines could cause \\nserious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. \\xa0\\nIf your doctor tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage  decision,” we will \\nautomatically agree to give you a fast coverage  decision. \\xa0\\nIf you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor’s support, we \\nwill decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we \\ndo not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that:\\n\\nPage_185: \\n185 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Explains that we will use the standard deadlines\\nExplains if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give \\nyou a fast coverage decision \\xa0\\nExplains that you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give you a standard \\ncoverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. \\xa0\\nStep 2:  Ask our plan to make a coverage decision or fast coverage decision.\\nStart by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or \\nprovide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative \\ncan do this.

A “fast appeal” is generally made within \\n72 hours. \\xa0\\nIf you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care that you have not yet \\nreceived, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a “fast appeal.” If your \\ndoctor tells us that your health requires a “fast appeal,” we will give you a fast appeal.\\nThe requirements for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting a “fast \\ncoverage decision” in Section 5.2 of this chapter.\\nStep 2: Ask our plan for an appeal or a Fast appeal\\nIf you are asking for a standard appeal, submit your standard appeal in writing. Chapter \\n2 has contact information.\\nIf you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us. Chapter 2 has \\ncontact information. \\xa0\\nYou must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written \\nnotice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and \\nhave a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late when you make \\nyour appeal. We may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may \\ninclude a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with \\nincorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal.\\nYou can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision. You and your \\ndoctor may add more information to support your appeal.\\nStep 3:  We consider your appeal and we give you our answer.\\nWhen our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take a careful look at all of the information. We \\ncheck to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request.\\nWe will gather more information if needed, possibly contacting you or your doctor. \\xa0\\nDeadlines for a “fast appeal”\\n\\nPage_187: \\n187 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your \\nappeal .

To keep things simple, we \\ngenerally say “drug” in the rest of this section, instead of repeating “covered outpatient \\nprescription drug” or “Part D drug” every time. We also use the term “drug list” instead of “List \\nof Covered Drugs” or “Formulary.”\\nIf you do not know if a drug is covered or if you meet the rules, you can ask us.

Here are three examples of exceptions \\nthat you or your doctor or other prescriber can ask us to make:\\nCovering a Part D drug for you that is not on our Drug List. If we agree to cover a drug not \\non the Drug List, you will need to pay the cost-sharing amount that applies to Tier 4 for \\nbrand name drugs or for generic drugs. You cannot ask for an exception to the cost-sharing \\namount we require you to pay for the drug.\\n\\nPage_192: \\n192 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n2.\\n3.\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Removing a restriction for a covered drug . Chapter 5 describes the extra rules or \\nrestrictions that apply to certain drugs on our Drug List. If we agree to make an exception \\nand waive a restriction for you, you can ask for an exception to the copayment or \\ncoinsurance amount we require you to pay for the drug.\\nChanging coverage of a drug to a lower cost-sharing tier. Every drug on our Drug List is in \\none of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the lower the cost-sharing tier number, the less you \\nwill pay as your share of the cost of the drug.\\nIf our drug list contains alternative drug(s) for treating your medical condition that are in a \\nlower cost-sharing tier than your drug, you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost-sharing \\namount that applies to the alternative drug(s).\\nIf the drug you’re taking is a brand name drug you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost-  \\nsharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains brand name alternatives for \\ntreating your condition. \\xa0\\nIf the drug you’re taking is a generic drug you can ask us to cover your drug at the cost-  \\nsharing amount that applies to the lowest tier that contains either brand or generic \\nalternatives for treating your condition.\\nYou cannot ask us to change the cost-sharing tier for any drug in Tier 5.\\nIf we approve your tiering exception request and there is more than one lower cost-sharing \\ntier with alternative drugs you can’t take, you will usually pay the lowest amount.\\nSection 6.3 Important things to know about asking for exceptions\\nYour doctor must tell us the medical reasons\\nYour doctor or other prescriber must give us a statement that explains the medical reasons for \\nrequesting an exception. For a faster decision, include this medical information from your doctor \\nor other prescriber when you ask for the exception.\\nTypically, our Drug List includes more than one drug for treating a particular condition. These \\ndifferent possibilities are called “alternative” drugs. If an alternative drug would be just as \\neffective as the drug you are requesting and would not cause more side effects or other health \\nproblems, we will generally not approve your request for an exception. If you ask us for a tiering \\nexception, we will generally not approve your request for an exception unless all the alternative \\ndrugs in the lower cost-sharing tier(s) won’t work as well for you or are likely to cause an adverse \\nreaction or other harm.\\nWe can say yes or no to your request\\nIf we approve your request for an exception, our approval usually is valid until the end of \\nthe plan year. This is true as long as your doctor continues to prescribe the drug for you and \\nthat drug continues to be safe and effective for treating your condition.\\nIf we say no to your request, you can ask for another review by making an appeal.\\n\\nPage_193: \\n193 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 9 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, \\ncomplaints)\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•Section 6.4 Step-by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision, including an \\nexception\\nLegal Terms\\nA “fast coverage decision” is called an “expedited coverage determination.”\\nStep 1:  Decide if you need a “standard coverage decision” or a “fast coverage decision.”\\n“Standard coverage decisions”  are made within 72 hours  after we receive your doctor’s \\nstatement. “Fast coverage decisions” are made within 24 hours after we receive your doctor’s \\nstatement.\\nIf your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision.”  To get a fast coverage \\ndecision, you must meet two requirements:\\nYou must be asking for a drug you have not yet received.

You assign to us your right or your heir\\'s or executor\\'s right to \\ntake legal action against any responsible third party, and you agree, on behalf of yourself, heirs, \\nexecutors, and other representatives to: \\xa0\\nProvide any relevant information that we request; and\\nParticipate in any phase of legal action, such as discovery, depositions, and trial testimony, \\nif needed.\\nIf you or your heirs, executors, or other representatives don\\'t cooperate with us or our \\nrepresentatives, or you or they do anything that interferes with our rights, we may take legal \\naction against you or them. You also agree not to assign your right to take legal action to \\nsomeone else without our written consent. \\xa0\\nOur right of reimbursement \\xa0\\nWe also have the right to be reimbursed if a third party pays you directly. If you receive any \\namount as a judgment, settlement, or other payment from any third party, you must immediately \\nreimburse us for the costs we paid for health care or other goods and services arising out of, \\nrelating to, or incidental to such injury, illness, or condition. We are not obligated to pursue \\nreimbursement or take legal action against a third party, either for our own benefit or on your \\nbehalf. Our rights under Medicare law and this Evidence of Coverage will not be affected if we \\ndon\\'t participate in any legal action you take related to your injury, illness, or condition. Our \\nrights to reimbursement applies regardless of the amount of the judgment, settlement, or other \\npayment and regardless if such monies are less than the amount we paid for health care or other \\ngoods and services.\\nSECTION 5 Notice of coordination of benefits\\nWhy do we need to know if you have other coverage? \\xa0\\nWe coordinate benefits in accordance with the Medicare Secondary Payer rules, which allow us to \\nbill, or authorize a provider of services to bill, other insurance carriers, plans, policies, employers, \\nor other entities when the other payer is responsible for payment of services provided to you. We \\nare also authorized to charge or bill you for amounts the other third party has already paid to you \\nfor such services. We reserve all rights afforded to us under the Medicare Program, including, \\nwithout limitation, all Medicare Secondary Payer rights. \\xa0\\n\\nPage_227: \\n227 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 11 : Legal Notices\\n•\\n•\\n•Who pays first when you have other coverage? \\xa0\\nWhen you have additional coverage, how we coordinate your coverage depends on your situation. \\nWith coordination of benefits, you will often get your care as usual through our plan providers, \\nand the other plan or plans you have will simply help pay for the care you receive. If you have \\ngroup health coverage, you may be able to maximize the benefits available to you if you use \\nproviders who participate in your group plan and our plan. In other situations, such as for \\nbenefits that are not covered by our plan, you may get your care outside of our plan. \\xa0\\nEmployer and employee organization group health plans \\xa0\\nSometimes, a group health plan must provide health benefits to you before we will provide health \\nbenefits to you. This happens if:\\nYou have coverage under a group health plan (including both employer and employee \\norganization plans), either directly or through your spouse, and \\xa0\\nThe employer has twenty (20) or more employees (as determined by Medicare rules), and \\xa0\\nYou are not covered by Medicare due to disability or other criteria.\\nIf the employer has fewer than twenty (20) employees, generally we will provide your primary \\nhealth benefits. If you have retiree coverage under a group health plan, either directly or through \\nyour spouse, generally we will provide primary health benefits.\\nWorkers\\' compensation and similar programs \\xa0\\nIf you have suffered a job-related illness or injury and workers\\' compensation benefits are \\navailable to you, workers\\' compensation must provide its benefits first for any healthcare costs \\nrelated to your job-related illness or injury before we will provide any benefits under this \\nEvidence of Coverage for services rendered in connection with your job-related illness or injury.\\nAccidents and injuries \\xa0\\nThe Medicare Secondary Payer rules apply if you have been in an accident or suffered an injury. If \\nbenefits under “Med Pay,” no-fault, automobile, accident, or other liability coverage are available \\nto you, the “Med Pay,” no-fault, automobile, accident, or other liability coverage carrier must \\nprovide its benefits first for any healthcare costs related to the accident or injury before we will \\nprovide any benefits for services related to your accident or injury.\\nLiability insurance claims are often not settled promptly. We may make conditional payments \\nwhile the liability claim is pending. We may also receive a claim and not know that a liability or \\nother claim is pending. In these situations, our payments are conditional. Conditional payments \\nmust be refunded to us upon your receipt of any insurance proceeds, judgment, settlement, or \\nother payment.\\nIf you recover from a third party for medical-related expenses, we are entitled to recovery of \\npayments we have made without regard to any settlement agreement stipulations. Stipulations \\nthat the settlement does not include damages for medical expenses will be disregarded. We will \\nrecognize allocations of liability payments to non-medical losses only when payment is based on \\n\\nPage_228: \\n228 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 11 : Legal Notices\\na court order on the merits of the case. We will not seek recovery from any portion of an award \\nthat is appropriately designated by the court as payment for property losses; provided, however, \\nwe may pursue recovery of payments we have made if the allocation is designated as other than \\nproperty losses (e.g., pain and suffering).\\nWhere we provide benefits in the form of services, we shall be entitled to reimbursement on the \\nbasis of the reasonable value of the benefits provided.\\nNon-duplication of benefits \\xa0\\nWe will not duplicate any benefits or payments you receive under any automobile, accident, \\nliability, or other coverage. You agree to notify us when such coverage is available to you, and it \\nis your responsibility to take any actions necessary to receive benefits or payments under such \\nautomobile, accident, liability, or other coverage. We may seek reimbursement of the reasonable \\nvalue of any benefits we have provided in the event that we have duplicated benefits to which \\nyou are entitled under such coverage. You are obligated to cooperate with us in obtaining \\npayment from any automobile, accident, or liability coverage or other carrier.\\nIf we do provide benefits to you before any other type of health coverage you may have, we may \\nseek recovery of those benefits in accordance with the Medicare Secondary Payer rules. Please \\nalso refer to the Additional Notice about Subrogation (Recovery from a Third Party) section for \\nmore information on our recovery rights.\\nMore information\\nThis is just a brief summary. Whether we pay first or second - or at all - depends on what types of \\nadditional insurance you have and the Medicare rules that apply to your situation. For more \\ninformation, consult the brochure published by the government called “Medicare & Other Health \\nBenefits: Your Guide to Who Pays First.” It is CMS Pub. No. 02179. Be sure to consult the most \\ncurrent version. Other details are explained in the Medicare Secondary Payer rules, such as the \\nway the number of persons employed by an employer for purposes of the coordination of benefits \\nrules is to be determined.

You may also make an appeal if you disagree with our decision to stop services \\nthat you are receiving.\\nBalance Billing  – When a provider (such as a doctor or hospital) bills a patient more than the \\nplan’s allowed cost-sharing amount. As a member of Devoted PRIME (HMO), you only have to pay \\nour plan’s cost-sharing amounts when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow \\nproviders to “balance bill” or otherwise charge you more than the amount of cost-sharing your \\nplan says you must pay.\\nBenefit Period  – The way that Original Medicare measures your use of hospital and skilled \\nnursing facility (SNF) services. Our plan measures your use of skilled nursing facility services in \\nbenefit periods. Our plan’s definition of a benefit period begins the day you go into a skilled \\nnursing facility. The benefit period ends when you have not received any inpatient hospital care \\nor skilled care in a SNF for 60 days in a row. If you go into a skilled nursing facility after one \\nbenefit period has ended, a new benefit period begins. There is no limit to the number of benefit \\nperiods.\\nBrand Name Drug  – A prescription drug that is manufactured and sold by the pharmaceutical \\ncompany that originally researched and developed the drug. Brand name drugs have the same \\nactive-ingredient formula as the generic version of the drug. However, generic drugs are \\nmanufactured and sold by other drug manufacturers and are generally not available until after \\nthe patent on the brand name drug has expired.\\nCatastrophic Coverage Stage  – The stage in the Part D Drug Benefit where you pay a low \\ncopayment or coinsurance for your drugs after you or other qualified parties on your behalf have \\nspent $7,400 in covered drugs during the covered year. \\xa0\\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  – The Federal agency that administers \\nMedicare. Chapter 2 explains how to contact CMS.\\nChronic-Care Special Needs Plan  – C-SNPs are SNPs that restrict enrollment to special needs \\nindividuals with specific severe or disabling chronic conditions, defined in 42 CFR 422.2.

A \\ncopayment is a set amount (for example $10), rather than a percentage.\\nCost Sharing  – Cost sharing refers to amounts that a member has to pay when services or drugs \\nare received. (This is in addition to the plan’s monthly premium.) Cost sharing includes any \\ncombination of the following three types of payments: (1) any deductible amount a plan may \\nimpose before services or drugs are covered; (2) any fixed “copayment” amount that a plan \\nrequires when a specific service or drug is received; or (3) any “coinsurance” amount, a \\npercentage of the total amount paid for a service or drug, that a plan requires when a specific \\nservice or drug is received.\\nCost-Sharing Tier  – Every drug on the list of covered drugs is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In \\ngeneral, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug.\\nCoverage Determination  – A decision about whether a drug prescribed for you is covered by the \\nplan and the amount, if any, you are required to pay for the prescription. In general, if you bring \\nyour prescription to a pharmacy and the pharmacy tells you the prescription isn’t covered under \\nyour plan, that isn’t a coverage determination. You need to call or write to your plan to ask for a \\nformal decision about the coverage. Coverage determinations are called “coverage decisions” in \\nthis document.\\nCovered Drugs  – The term we use to mean all of the prescription drugs covered by our plan.\\nCovered Services  – The term we use in this EOC to mean all of the health care services and \\nsupplies that are covered by our plan.\\nCreditable Prescription Drug Coverage  – Prescription drug coverage (for example, from an \\nemployer or union) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard \\nprescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage when they become eligible for \\nMedicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty, if they decide to enroll in \\nMedicare prescription drug coverage later.\\n\\nPage_232: \\n232 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Devoted PRIME (HMO)  \\nChapter 12 : Definitions of important words\\nCustodial Care  – Custodial care is personal care provided in a nursing home, hospice, or other \\nfacility setting when you do not need skilled medical care or skilled nursing care. Custodial care, \\nprovided by people who do not have professional skills or training, includes help with activities of \\ndaily living like bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of a bed or chair, moving around, and \\nusing the bathroom. It \\xa0may also include the kind of health-related care that most people do \\nthemselves, like using eye drops. Medicare doesn’t pay for custodial care.\\nDaily cost-sharing rate  – A “daily cost-sharing rate” may apply when your doctor prescribes less \\nthan a full month’s supply of certain drugs for you and you are required to pay a copayment. A \\ndaily cost-sharing rate is the copayment divided by the number of days in a month’s supply. Here \\nis an example: If your copayment for a one-month supply of a drug is $30, and a one month’s \\nsupply in your plan is 30 days, then your “daily cost-sharing rate” is $1 per day.\\nDeductible  – The amount you must pay for health care or prescriptions before our plan pays. \\xa0\\nDisenroll or Disenrollment  – The process of ending your membership in our plan.\\nDispensing Fee  – A fee charged each time a covered drug is dispensed to pay for the cost of \\nfilling a prescription, such as the pharmacist’s time to prepare and package the prescription.\\nDual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP)  – D-SNPs enroll individuals who are entitled to both \\nMedicare (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) and medical assistance from a state plan under \\nMedicaid (title XIX).
